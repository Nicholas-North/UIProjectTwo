How will you communicate? 
We have created a group discord chat for communication, and also have planned weekly meetings on tuesday nights to go over projet progress and next steps. We will also be communicating via work items on a GitHub repo project.

How will you coordinate work? 
During our ideation phase (Interviews, collecting information, creating a list of deliverables), we will create a list of over-arching requirements that will serve as categories for which work items will fall under. These work items will be all of the small segments and components that are required to either accomplish said requirement, or some other task i.e. sketching. We will then create a gantt chart to organize which task need to be done first, and which ones can be accomplished concurrently; after which we will assign tasks evenly/based on expertise in order to spread the workload.

Do you plan to have regular meetings? 
Yes, once a week, but communication will continue throughout, not just on Tuesday.

Have you discussed team conflicts or obligations during the project time-frame? 
Yes. We have made a plan of holding each other accountable to the reccomended project dealines underneath the project description. If we realize over the course of the week or during one of our meetings that someone is falling behind their listed work item, we will message them about it and try to create a plan to get back on track for them if it's not slack the others can take on. If this doesn't work, and the person is being uncooperative, we shall message the professor about it. 

How will you divide the work? 
We will try to keep it evenly split amongst the team members as to avoid overloading them with tasks; especially depending on their overall schedule.
