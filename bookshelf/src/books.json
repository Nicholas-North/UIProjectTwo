{"author":"Stephen H. Case,Mark Jacob","desc":"Histories of the Revolutionary War have long honored heroines such as Betsy Ross, Abigail Adams, and Molly Pitcher. Now, more than two centuries later, comes the first biography of one of the war's most remarkable women, a beautiful Philadelphia society girl named Peggy Shippen. While war was raging between England and its rebellious colonists, Peggy befriended a suave British officer and then married a crippled revolutionary general twice her age. She brought the two men together in a treasonous plot that nearly turned George Washington into a prisoner and changed the course of the war. Peggy Shippen was Mrs. Benedict Arnold.,After the conspiracy was exposed, Peggy managed to convince powerful men like Washington and Alexander Hamilton of her innocence. The Founding Fathers were handicapped by the common view that women lacked the sophistication for politics or warfare, much less treason. And Peggy took full advantage.,Peggy was to the American Revolution what the fictional Scarlett O'Hara was to the Civil War: a woman whose survival skills trumped all other values. Had she been a man, she might have been arrested, tried, and executed. And she might have become famous. Instead, her role was minimized and she was allowed to recede into the background - with a generous British pension in hand.,In ,Treacherous Beauty,, Mark Jacob and Stephen H. Case tell the true story of Peggy Shippen, a driving force in a conspiracy that came within an eyelash of dooming the American democracy.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1344730120l\/13202967.jpg","pages":288,"rating":3.84,"reviews":33,"title":"Treacherous Beauty: Peggy Shippen, the Woman behind Benedict Arnold's Plot to Betray America","totalratings":273,"genre":"Non-Fiction","shelf":"Shelf A"},

Our perpetual connectedness gives us endless opportunities to be part of the give-and-take of networking.,Some worry that this new environment makes us isolated and lonely. But in Networked, Lee Rainie and Barry Wellman show how the large, loosely knit social circles of networked individuals expand opportunities for learning, problem solving, decision making, and personal interaction. The new social operating system of \"networked individualism\" liberates us from the restrictions of tightly knit groups; it also requires us to develop networking skills and strategies, work on maintaining ties, and balance multiple overlapping networks. Rainie and Wellman outline the \"triple revolution\" that has brought on this transformation: the rise of social networking, the capacity of the Internet to empower individuals, and the always-on connectivity of mobile devices. Drawing on extensive evidence, they examine how the move to networked individualism has expanded personal relationships beyond households and neighborhoods; transformed work into less hierarchical, more team-driven enterprises; encouraged individuals to create and share content; and changed the way people obtain information. Rainie and Wellman guide us through the challenges and opportunities of living in the evolving world of networked individuals.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1339229719l\/13697455.jpg","pages":439,"rating":3.43,"reviews":22,"title":"Networked: The New Social Operating System","totalratings":202,"genre":"Technology, Non-Fiction, Science","shelf":"Shelf A"},

She gives us her recipe for short ribs along with a story about a job she had as a cook at a Creole restaurant (never mind that she didn't know how to cook and had no idea what Creole food might entail). There was the time in London when she attended a wretched dinner party full of wretched people; but all wasn't lost-she did experience her initial taste of a savory onion tart. She recounts her very first night in her new home in Sonoma, California, when she invited M. F. K. Fisher over for cassoulet, and the evening Deca Mitford roasted a chicken when she was beyond tipsy-and created Chicken Drunkard Style.

A Swedish proverb speaks of placing the church in the middle of the village, & that is precisely what Nilsson has here done. Homer & Hesiod formed the basis of the traditional education of the Greeks in general, & the great gods & goddesses as they appear in art show at all times the formative influence of the epic tradition. Nevertheless, the hard core of Greek religion is to be found in its observances--these took their shape among men whose focus was 1st the hearth & then the city-state, men moreover whose life & livelihood were tied to crops & herds & the annual cycle of nature.\"--Arthur Darby Nock, Nilsson writes about the popular religious observances of the Greeks, as practiced both earlier in the 20th century & in classical times, the agricultural festivals & customs, the rituals of family & society. The folk religions of Greece that underlay & continually erupted into the more elevated Olympian mythology of Homer & Hesiod are explained in detail by a scholar with unparalleled understanding of the rites & customs of rural life., Martin P.

{"author":"Andrew C. Isenberg","desc":"The Destruction of the Bison explains the decline of the North American bison population from an estimated 30 million in 1800 to fewer than 1000 a century later. In this wide-ranging, interdisciplinary study, Andrew C. Isenberg argues that the cultural and ecological encounter between Native Americans and Euroamericans in the Great Plains was the central cause of the near extinction of the bison. Drought and the incursion of domestic livestock and exotic species such as horses into the Great Plains all threatened the Western ecosystem, which was further destabilized as interactions between Native Americans and Euroamericans created new types of hunters in both cultures: mounted Indian nomads and white commercial hide hunters. In the early twentieth century, nostalgia about the very cultural strife that first threatened the bison became, ironically, an important impetus to its preservation.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1348006622l\/1036690.jpg","pages":220,"rating":3.74,"reviews":10,"title":"The Destruction of the Bison: An Environmental History, 1750-1920","totalratings":122,"genre":"Non-Fiction, Science","shelf":"Shelf A"},

{"author":"David M. Glantz","desc":"The German siege and Soviet defense of Leningrad in World War II was an epic struggle in an epic war, a drama of heroism and human misery unmatched in the annals of modern warfare. While innumerable writers have dealt at length with the besieged city itself, David Glantz provides for the first time the definitive military history of the conflict waged beyond the city's borders.,One of the first major Soviet cities threatened by the German blitzkrieg, Leningrad was as much a symbolic target as it was a strategic one for Adolf Hitler, who fully expected the birthplace of the Russian Revolution to be reduced to rubble quickly and with ease. The Red Army's ferocious defense of the city, however, made that impossible.,Glantz digs deep to recount the full story of how these two military giants bludgeoned each other for nearly three years with a relentless barrage of offensives and counter-offensives designed to crush one another, in horrendous weather and a harsh terrain and with staggering loss of life on both sides. His richly detailed history shows how battles and campaigns were conceived, engaged, and resolved--including a half dozen or more forgotten battles that took place during the blockade.,From a crazy quilt of military operations, Glantz reconstructs the border battles of June and July 1941; the little-known battles to liberate southern Leningrad oblast, including the battles for Luga, Narva, Pskov, and Ostrov; and the liberation of northern Leningrad oblast, comprising the Vyborg operation and failed attempts to invade Finland. He explains how these battles shaped the struggle for Leningrad and how they impacted other theaters of operation along the Eastern Front, eventually forcing the Germans into their long and costly retreat back toward Berlin.,Glantz also provides insights into conditions within the city, adding new details to the horrors of the siege; sheds new light on partisan warfare in the countryside surrounding Leningrad; and corrects errors found in earlier works, revealing among other things the fate of those Soviet commanders who were purged or repressed because of their poor performance in battle.,Based on an unparalleled access to Russian archival sources and going far beyond the military aspects of such renowned works as Harrison Salisbury's 900 Days, Glantz's book is a testament to the nearly two million Russians who lost their lives during the Leningrad conflict and confirms his status as the preeminent authority on the Russian military experience in World War II.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1347669948l\/1295158.jpg","pages":684,"rating":3.98,"reviews":6,"title":"The Battle for Leningrad, 1941-1944","totalratings":61,"genre":"Non-Fiction","shelf":"Shelf A"},
{"author":"Mark P.O. Morford,Amy Aronson","desc":"Thoroughly updated and revised, the second edition of ,The Gendered Society, explores current thinking about gender, both inside academia and in our everyday lives. Part I examines the latest work in biology, anthropology, psychology, and sociology; Part II provides an original analysis of the gendered worlds of family, education, and work; and Part III focuses on the gendered interactions of friendship and love, sexuality, and violence. As a result of his research, author Michael S. Kimmel makes three claims about gender. First, he argues that the differences between men and women are not as great as we often imagine, and that in fact women and men have far more in common with one another than we think they do. Second, he challenges the notions of the many pop psychologists who suggest that gender difference is the cause of the dramatic observable inequality between the sexes. Instead, Kimmel reveals that the reverse is true: gender inequality is the cause of the differences between women and men. Third, he argues that gender is not simply an aspect of individual identity but is also an institutional phenomenon, embedded in the organizations and institutions in which we interact daily. Kimmel concludes with a brief epilogue looking ahead to gender relations in the new century. The second edition includes a new chapter, The Gendered Body, and a sharper critique of biological differences. ,The Gendered Society, 2\/e,, is a well-reasoned, authoritative, and keenly animated statement about contemporary gender relations, written by one of the country's foremost thinkers on the subject. It is an essential text for both scholars and students alike. Kimmel's companion book, ,The Gendered Society Reader, 2\/e,, (OUP, 2003), provides a perfect complement for classroom use.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1172183330l\/146980.jpg","pages":352,"rating":3.9,"reviews":23,"title":"The Gendered Society","totalratings":256,"genre":"Non-Fiction, Science","shelf":"Shelf A"},

{"author":"Pin Ho,Wenguang Huang","desc":"The downfall of Bo Xilai in China was more than a darkly thrilling mystery. It revealed a cataclysmic internal power struggle between Communist Party factions, one that reached all the way to China's new president Xi Jinping., The scandalous story of the corruption of the Bo Xilai family -- the murder of British businessman Neil Heywood; Bo's secret lovers; the secret maneuverings of Bo's supporters; the hasty trial and sentencing of Gu Kailai, Bo's wife -- was just the first rumble of a seismic power struggle that continues to rock the very foundation of China's all-powerful Communist Party. By the time it is over, the machinations in Beijing and throughout the country that began with Bo's fall could affect China's economic development and disrupt the world's political and economic order., Pin Ho and Wenguang Huang have pieced together the details of this fascinating political drama from firsthand reporting and an unrivaled array of sources, some very high in the Chinese government. This was the first scandal in China to play out in the international media -- details were leaked, sometimes invented, to non-Chinese news outlets as part of the power plays that rippled through the government. The attempt to manipulate the Western media, especially, was a fundamental dimension to the story, and one that affected some of the early reporting. ,A Death in the Lucky Holiday Hotel, returns to the scene of the crime and shows not only what happened in Room 1605 but how the threat of the story was every bit as important in the life and death struggle for power that followed. It touched celebrities and billionaires and redrew the cast of the new leadership of the Communist Party. The ghost of Neil Heywood haunts China to this day.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1352794965l\/15843143.jpg","pages":352,"rating":3.74,"reviews":37,"title":"A Death in the Lucky Holiday Hotel: Murder, Money, and an Epic Power Struggle in China","totalratings":265,"genre":"Non-Fiction, Mystery","shelf":"Shelf A"},

{"author":"Carl DiSalvo","desc":"In \" Adversarial Design,\" Carl DiSalvo examines the ways that technology design can provoke and engage the political. He describes a practice, which he terms \"adversarial design,\" that uses the means and forms of design to challenge beliefs, values, and what is taken to be fact. It is not simply applying design to politics--attempting to improve governance, for example, by redesigning ballots and polling places; it is implicitly contestational and strives to question conventional approaches to political issues. DiSalvo explores the political qualities and potentials of design by examining a series of projects that span design and art, engineering and computer science, agitprop and consumer products. He views these projects-- which include computational visualizations of networks of power and influence, therapy robots that shape sociability, and everyday objects embedded with microchips that enable users to circumvent surveillance--through the lens of agonism, a political theory that emphasizes contention as foundational to democracy. Each of these projects engages one of three categories as a medium--information, robots, and ubiquitous computing--and in each of them certain distinctive qualities of computation are used for political ends or to bring forth political issues. DiSalvo's illuminating analysis aims to provide design criticism with a new approach for thinking about the relationship between forms of political expression, computation as a medium, and the processes and products of design.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1340758165l\/13628388.jpg","pages":168,"rating":3.89,"reviews":6,"title":"Adversarial Design","totalratings":45,"genre":"Art, Technology, Non-Fiction, Science","shelf":"Shelf A"},
{"author":"Joshua Harris","desc":"While most Christians agree to seek purity and save sex for marriage, few have been given a blueprint for how that should affect their view of dating and love. In ,I Kissed Dating Goodbye,, Joshua Harris exposes the \"Seven Habits of Highly Defective Dating\" and offers a realistic outline of how to have a biblical vision of marriage. Harris contends that one must begin with a new attitude, viewing love, purity, and singleness from God's perspective rather than thinking that love and romance are to be enjoyed \"solely for recreation.\" In such well-named chapters as \"Guarding Your Heart\" and \"What Matters at Fifty,\" Harris encourages the reader to look at one's character rather than reveling in infatuation, to regard love as a truly selfless, biblical act rather than a feeling. He refutes the concept that we are victims of \"falling in love\" (that it is beyond our control), saying that \"God wants us to seek guidance from scriptural truth, not feeling. Smart love looks beyond personal desires and the gratification of the moment. It looks at the big picture: serving others and glorifying God.\" Before you roll your eyes, moaning that this sounds terribly unromantic, know that Harris does a superb job of couching his convictions in the sincere belief that if we are purposeful in our singleness and date with integrity, a fulfilled marriage awaits us--in God's timing. ,--Jill Heatherly","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1320506446l\/107195.jpg","pages":221,"rating":3.53,"reviews":933,"title":"I Kissed Dating Goodbye: A New Attitude Toward Relationships and Romance","totalratings":20418,"genre":"Non-Fiction, Romance, Religion","shelf":"Shelf A"},

{"author":"Nina Simonds","desc":"From Nina Simonds, the best-selling authority on Chinese cooking, here is a groundbreaking cookbook based on the Asian philosophy of food as health-giving. The 200 delectable recipes she offers not only taste superb but also have specific healing properties according to the accumulated wisdom of traditional Chinese medicine.,The emphasis is on what's good for you, not bad for you. It's primarily a question of balance: eating in harmony with the seasons; countering yin, or cooling, foods (spinach, tomatoes, asparagus, lettuce, seafood) with yang, or hot, foods (ginger, garlic, hot peppers, beef) and neutralizers like rice and noodles.,Feeling tired? Ms. Simonds offers a spoonful of ginger in her hearty chicken soup. A cold coming on? Try Cantonese-Style Tofu (to sweat out the cold) in Black Bean Sauce (healing to the lungs and digestion). Your immune system needs building up? Wild mushrooms (a cancer deterrent) are tossed with soba noodles (a stress reliever). Concerned about cholesterol and clogged arteries? Instead of giving up all the foods you love, indulge in Yin-Yang Shrimp with Hawthorn Dipping Sauce.,Whatever your health concerns may be, you will find the right restorative and satisfying recipes. Babies and toddlers have special needs, as do adolescents, pregnant and menopausal women, the aging--and all of these are addressed with specific recommendations.

But, above all, it is the range of dishes, from the exotic to the earthy, that will convince you that you can enjoy marvelous food every day--relishing its good taste and knowing it is good for you.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1320469659l\/1282555.jpg","pages":336,"rating":4.15,"reviews":8,"title":"A Spoonful of Ginger : Irresistible Health-Giving Recipes from Asian Kitchens","totalratings":103,"genre":"Cooking","shelf":"Shelf A"},
{"author":"John Robert Christianson","desc":"A Platonic philosopher, Paracelsian chemist, Ovidian poet, and devoted family man, Tycho Brahe was the last Renaissance man and the first great organizer of modern science. This book provides the fullest portrait available of the research and cultural interests of the man who became the premier patron-practitioner of science in sixteenth-century Europe. Starting from Brahe's well reputed role of astronomer, author Christianson adds lesser known details of the man who was both a geodetic surveyor as well as a garden designer, and ultimately established a new role of scientist as administrator, active reformer, and natural philosopher. Coverage reveals how from his private island in Denmark, Brahe used patronage, printing, friendship, and marriage to incorporate men and women skilled in science, technology, and the fine arts into his program of cosmic reform. Through their teamwork, they achieved breakthroughs in astronomy, scientific method, and research organization that were essential to the birth of modern science. Also included are over 100 capsule biographies of Tycho's clients, coworkers, and friends, including Johannes Kepler, Willebrord Snel, Willem Blaeu, several bishops, and numerous technical specialists all of whom helped shape the culture of the Scientific Revolution. This pioneering exposition will appeal to science history buffs, especially those with an interest in the late Renaissance and will inspire anyone who has a passion for science and a penchant for the world of ideas. John Robert Christianson received his Ph.D. from the University of Minnesota. He was dubbed Knight of the Royal Norwegian Order of Merit by King Harald II in 1995.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1347423668l\/1060259.jpg","pages":464,"rating":3.94,"reviews":8,"title":"On Tycho's Island: Tycho Brahe and His Assistants, 1570-1601","totalratings":32,"genre":"Non-Fiction, Science","shelf":"Shelf A"},

{"author":"Charles Barber","desc":"Public perceptions of mental health issues have changed dramatically over the last fifteen years, and nowhere is this more apparent than in the rampant overmedication of ordinary Americans. In 2006, 227 million antidepressant prescriptions were dispensed in the United States, more than any other class of medication; in that same year, the United States accounted for 66 percent of the global antidepressant market. In ,Comfortably Numb, ,Charles Barber provides a much-needed context for this disturbing phenomenon.,Barber explores the ways in which pharmaceutical companies first create the need for a drug and then rush to fill it, and he reveals that the increasing pressure Americans are under to medicate themselves (direct-to-consumer advertising, fewer nondrug therapeutic options, the promise of the quick fix, the blurring of distinction between mental illness and everyday problems). Most importantly, he convincingly argues that without an industry to promote them, non-pharmaceutical approaches that could have the potential to help millions are tragically overlooked by a nation that sees drugs as an instant cure for all emotional difficulties.,Here is an unprecedented account of the impact of psychiatric medications on American culture and on Americans themselves.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1442369131l\/1582229._SX318_.jpg","pages":304,"rating":3.74,"reviews":55,"title":"Comfortably Numb: How Psychiatry Is Medicating a Nation","totalratings":245,"genre":"Sports, Non-Fiction, Science","shelf":"Shelf A"},

{"author":"Michael Prestwich","desc":"Medieval warfare was hard, gruelling and often unrewarding. While military life in this era is sometimes pictured in terms of knights resplendent in armour and bearing colourful standards and coats of arms, the reality more often consisted of men struggling against cold, damp and hunger, pressing elusive foes who refused to do battle. In this fascinating book, Michael Prestwich re-creates the real experience of medieval warfare, examining how men of all ranks of society were recruited, how troops were fed, supplied, and deployed, the development of new weapons, and the structures of military command. Michael Prestwich challenges many common assumptions about medieval warfare. He shows that medieval commanders were capable of far more sophisticated strategy than is usually assumed: spies were an important part of the machinery of war, and the destruction of crops and burning of villages were part of a deliberate plan to force a foe to negotiate, rather than an indication of lack of discipline. Sieges, often lengthy and expensive, were more prevalent than physical battles. And in actual engagement the mounted knight was never as dominant as is often supposed: even in the twelfth century, many battles were won by unmounted men. Medieval warfare was not, on the whole, any more chivalric than warfare of other periods, although there were many instances of individual heroism, particularly during the Hundred Years War, that brought glory and renown to those who performed them.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1348564827l\/1490190.jpg","pages":352,"rating":3.95,"reviews":6,"title":"Armies and Warfare in the Middle Ages: The English Experience","totalratings":62,"genre":"Non-Fiction","shelf":"Shelf A"},

{"author":"Roberta Reeder,Anna Akhmatova","desc":"Tall, slender, austere, with features that were described as haunting and hypnotic, Akhmatova possessed a quiet reserve, combined with an unusual intensity, that early on attracted fellow artists. As Picasso changed the face of art, Akhmatova would revolutionize the poetic vision of her contemporaries, for it was she who introduced the laconic style of twentieth-century poetry that seemed to blend in with the modernist forces of her age. One of those writers on whom she cast her spell was Nicholas Gumilyov, a swashbuckling Hemingway type, an eminent literary figure in his own right, who became her first husband. On their honeymoon, they went to Paris in 1910, where they met Modigliani, with whom Akhmatova later had an affair, succeeded by other extremely close relationships with the likes of the composer Arthur Lourie and Osip Mandelstam. Akhmatova and Gumilyov's relationship was clearly strained from the start, and the two, in a love-hate style, tortured each other until their divorce in 1918. Only after Gumilyov was shot by the Bolsheviks in 1921 did Akhmatova realize how much he had meant to her. Friend and protector of writers like Pasternak and Mandelstam in the 1920s and 1950s, she was so lionized by her intellectual peers that even when the Bolsheviks turned on her poetry, the authorities feared to harm or kill her. When Mandelstam, for example, was arrested. Akhmatova was in his apartment, and she did everything she could to save him, before he later went mad and died under mysterious circumstances in 1958. Unlike Mandelstam, Pasternak chose to compromise, and wrote an ode to Lenin and translated other poems to Stalin, becoming for a while the government's literary \"golden boy.\"While Akhmatova was spared the physical torture of others, her son, Lev, was arrested several times, the authorities believing that she could be tortured through her son's imprisonment.

At dark seances spectators goggled at spirit hands descending form above, and fondled 'spirits' who had coyly emerged from cabinets. The age of reason had done away with the supernatural. But the Victorians wanted it back and they made certain they got it. Astrology and fortune-telling enjoyed a boom, and in country districts the witches and the cunning men plied their arts, selling and casting spells, and applying the evil eye. The Table-Rappers deals with all aspects of the Victorian occult - the credulity of believers certain that a thing of gauze and muslin was their dead aunt, the venom of the professional mediums who sabotaged each others' seances, and the still unexplained phenomena - levitations, the fire test where mediums handled red-hot coals, and strange materialisations where both spirits and mediums were in the room at the same time. Behind all the heavy breathing in darkened rooms, the implausible spirit photographs, the interminable dotty table-rapping and inconsequential scribbling on slates, lay a whole world of absurd tricksters, well-meaning dolts, credulous gulls and some unforgettable characters.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1387742777l\/1426007.jpg","pages":258,"rating":3.4,"reviews":7,"title":"Table Rappers: The Victorians and the Occult","totalratings":58,"genre":"Fantasy, Non-Fiction, Historical Fiction","shelf":"Shelf B"},

{"author":"Leonard L. Richards","desc":"During the bitter winter of 1786-87, Daniel Shays, a modest farmer and Revolutionary War veteran, and his compatriot Luke Day led an unsuccessful armed rebellion against the state of Massachusetts. Their desperate struggle was fueled by the injustice of a regressive tax system and a conservative state government that seemed no better than British colonial rule. But despite the immediate failure of this local call-to-arms in the Massachusetts countryside, the event fundamentally altered the course of American history. Shays and his army of four thousand rebels so shocked the young nation's governing elite--even drawing the retired General George Washington back into the service of his country--that ultimately the Articles of Confederation were discarded in favor of a new constitution, the very document that has guided the nation for more than two hundred years, and brought closure to the American Revolution.,The importance of Shays's Rebellion has never been fully appreciated, chiefly because Shays and his followers have always been viewed as a small group of poor farmers and debtors protesting local civil authority. In ,Shays's Rebellion: The American Revolution's Final Battle,, Leonard Richards reveals that this perception is misleading, that the rebellion was much more widespread than previously thought, and that the participants and their supporters actually represented whole communities--the wealthy and the poor, the influential and the weak, even members of some of the best Massachusetts families.,Through careful examination of contemporary records, including a long-neglected but invaluable list of the participants, Richards provides a clear picture of the insurgency, capturing the spirit of the rebellion, the reasons for the revolt, and its long-term impact on the participants, the state of Massachusetts, and the nation as a whole. Shays's Rebellion, though seemingly a local affair, was the revolution that gave rise to modern American democracy.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1348907772l\/166984.jpg","pages":216,"rating":3.75,"reviews":13,"title":"Shays's Rebellion: The American Revolution's Final Battle","totalratings":117,"genre":"Non-Fiction","shelf":"Shelf B"},

{"author":"Garrett Oliver,Tom Colicchio","desc":"For millennia, beer has been a staple beverage in cultures across the globe. After water and tea, it is the most popular drink in the world, and it is at the center of an over $450 billion industry. With the emergence of craft brewing and homebrewing, beer is experiencing a renaissance that is expanding the reach of the beer culture even further, bringing the art of brewing into homes and widening the interest in beer as an important cultural item.,The Oxford Companion to Beer is the first reference work to fully investigate the history and vast scope of beer, from the agricultural makeup of various beers to the technical elements of the brewing process, local effects of brewing on regions around the world, and social and political implications of sharing a beer. Entries not only define terms such as \"spent grain\" and \"wort,\" but give fascinating details about how these and other ingredients affect a beer's taste, texture, and popularity. Cultural entries on such topics as drinking songs or beer gardens offer vivid accounts of how our drinking traditions have shifted through history, and how these traditions vary in different parts of the world, from Japan to Mexico, New Zealand, and Brazil, among many other countries. The pioneers of beer-making are the subjects of biographical entries; the legacies they left behind, in the forms of the world's most popular beers and breweries, are recurrent themes throughout the book. ,Collectively the Companion has over 1,100 entries--written by 150 of the world's most prominent beer experts--as well as a foreword by renowned chef Tom Colicchio (star of television's Top Chef), thorough appendices, conversion tables, images throughout, and an index. Flipping through the book, readers will discover everything from why beer was first taxed to how drinkers throughout history have overcome temperance movements and how an \"ale conner\" determined the quality of a beer in the thirteenth century. (It involved sitting in a puddle of beer.),The Companion is comprehensive, unprecedented, and of great value to anyone who has ever had a curiosity or appetite for beer.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1348639712l\/10895489.jpg","pages":920,"rating":4.4,"reviews":17,"title":"The Oxford Companion to Beer","totalratings":387,"genre":"Cooking, Non-Fiction","shelf":"Shelf B"},

{"author":"Ben Kiernan","desc":"This book narrates the history of the different peoples who have lived in the three major regions of Viet Nam over the past 3,000 years. It brings to life their relationships with these regions' landscapes, water resources, and climatic conditions, their changing cultures and religious traditions, and their interactions with their neighbors in China and Southeast Asia. Key themes include the dramatic impact of changing weather patterns from ancient to medieval and modern times, the central importance of riverine and maritime communications, ecological and economic transformations, and linguistic and literary changes. The country's long experience of regional diversity, multi-ethnic populations, and a multi-religious heritage that ranges from local spirit cults to the influences of Buddhism, Confucianism and Catholicism, makes for a vividly pluralistic narrative. ,The arcs of Vietnamese history include the rise and fall of different political formations, from chiefdoms to Chinese provinces, from independent kingdoms to divided regions, civil wars, French colonies, and modern republics. In the twentieth century anticolonial nationalism, the worldwide depression, Japanese occupation, a French attempt at reconquest, the traumatic American-Vietnamese war, and the 1975 communist victory all set the scene for the making of contemporary Viet Nam. Rapid economic growth in recent decades has transformed this one-party state into a global trading nation. Yet its rich history still casts a long shadow. Along with other members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, Viet Nam is now involved in a tense territorial standoff in the South China Sea, as a rival of China and a <\"partner>\" of the United States. If its independence and future geographical unity seem assured, Viet Nam's regional security and prospects for democracy remain clouded.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1481145095l\/12781033._SY475_.jpg","pages":592,"rating":3.99,"reviews":13,"title":"Viet Nam: A History from Earliest Times to the Present","totalratings":82,"genre":"Non-Fiction","shelf":"Shelf B"},

{"author":"Louis Cozolino","desc":"In contrast to this view, recent theoretical perspectives and technological advances in brain imaging have revealed that the brain is an organ continually built and re-built by one's experiences. We are now beginning to learn that many forms of psychotherapy, developed in the absence of any scientific understanding of the brain, are supported by neuroscientific findings.,Louis Cozolino's ,The Neuroscience of Psychotherapy, illustrates in a clearly written and accessible way how the brain's architecture is related to the problems, passions, and aspirations of human beings. As Cozolino so eloquently argues, all forms of psychotherapy-from psychoanalysis to behavioral interventions-are successful to the extent to which they enhance change in relevant neural circuits.,Beginning with an overview of the intersecting fields of neuroscience and psychotherapy, this book delves into the brain's inner workings, from basic neuronal building blocks to complex systems of memory, language, and the organization of experience. It continues by explaining the development and organization of the healthy brain and the unhealthy brain. Common problems such as anxiety, trauma, and codependency are discussed from a scientific and clinical perspective. Cozolino concludes by introducing the emerging paradigm of the psychotherapist-as-neuroscientist and presents some practical applications of neuroscience to psychotherapy. Throughout the book, the science behind the brain's workings is applied to day-to-day experience and clinical practice.,Written for psychotherapists and others interested in the relationship between brain and behavior, this book encourages us to consider the brain when attempting to understand human development, mental illness, and psychological health.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1348037941l\/170013.jpg","pages":400,"rating":4.3,"reviews":31,"title":"The Neuroscience of Psychotherapy: Building and Rebuilding the Human Brain","totalratings":411,"genre":"Sports, Non-Fiction, Science","shelf":"Shelf B"},

Klare argues that in the early decades of the new millennium, wars will be fought not over ideology but over access to dwindling supplies of precious natural commodities. The political divisions of the Cold War, Klare asserts, have given way to a global scramble for oil, natural gas, minerals, and water. And as armies throughout the world define resource security as a primary objective, widespread instability is bound to follow, especially in those areas where competition for essential materials overlaps with long-standing territorial and religious disputes. In this clarifying view, the recent explosive conflict between the United States and Islamic extremism stands revealed as the predictable consequence of consumer nations seeking to protect the vital resources they depend on.,A much-needed assessment of a changed world, ,Resource Wars, is a compelling look at warfare in an era of rampant globalization and intense economic competition.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1317791206l\/149206.jpg","pages":304,"rating":3.75,"reviews":27,"title":"Resource Wars: The New Landscape of Global Conflict","totalratings":387,"genre":"Non-Fiction, Science","shelf":"Shelf B"},
{"author":"Joan Wallach Scott","desc":"In ,The Fantasy of Feminist History,, Joan Wallach Scott argues that feminist perspectives on history are enriched by psychoanalytic concepts, particularly fantasy. Tracing the evolution of her thinking about gender over the course of her career, the pioneering historian explains how her search for ways to more forcefully insist on gender as mutable rather than fixed or stable led her to psychoanalytic theory, which posits sexual difference as an insoluble dilemma. Scott suggests that it is the futile struggle to hold meaning in place that makes gender such an interesting historical object, an object that includes not only regimes of truth about sex and sexuality but also fantasies and transgressions that refuse to be regulated or categorized. Fantasy undermines any notion of psychic immutability or fixed identity, infuses rational motives with desire, and contributes to the actions and events that come to be narrated as history. Questioning the standard parameters of historiography and feminist politics, Scott advocates fantasy as a useful, even necessary, concept for feminist historical analysis.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1326752018l\/13206030.jpg","pages":200,"rating":3.47,"reviews":5,"title":"The Fantasy of Feminist History","totalratings":45,"genre":"Non-Fiction","shelf":"Shelf B"},

{"author":"Raymond C. Ortlund Jr.,R. Kent Hughes","desc":"How exactly does one become wise? With the overwhelming flood of information and opinion in our times--much of it a mixture of spin, sound bites, and trivialities--it is crucial we turn back to the Bible and pay close attention to the deep insights that have stood the test of time.,Proverbs 1:20 tells us that \"Wisdom cries aloud in the street, in the markets she raises her voice.\" The wisdom of God does not stand aloof, but instead graciously moves toward us, into the world where we live and struggle day by day--offering us her very best, if we will only listen.,Pastor and teacher Ray Ortlund unpacks the book of Proverbs in twenty-one straightforward sermons, providing a biblical worldview on everything from money, sex, and power to that of the daily routines of an average life. Drawing relevant parallels from ancient culture to present day, he helps us understand how the book of Proverbs is practical help for ordinary people going through everyday life.,Most importantly, Ortlund shows how the Proverbs point to Jesus and his counsel for the perplexed, his strength for the defeated, his warning to the proud, his mercy for the broken. With careful treatment of the Scriptures and uncomplicated language, ,Proverbs: Wisdom that Works, bridges the gap between real-life experience and the scholarly depth of many commentaries.,Part of the Preaching the Word series.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1369824387l\/14362902.jpg","pages":224,"rating":4.44,"reviews":27,"title":"Proverbs: Wisdom That Works","totalratings":181,"genre":"Non-Fiction, Religion","shelf":"Shelf B"},

{"author":"Mary McCarthy,A.O. Scott","desc":"Mary McCarthy was one of the leading literary figures of her time. In addition to the novels and memoirs for which she is best remembered, she was also a tireless literary and social critic. Starting out as a theater reviewer for \"Partisan Review\" in 1937, she quickly distinguished herself for her witty and fearless commentary on topics ranging from McCarthyism to the French New Novel to women's fashion magazines. McCarthy was an eager controversialist, unsparing in her dissection of anything she found phony or hypocritical. Her reviews are sharp, sometimes malicious, and often very funny, but her criticism is also informed by deep erudition and enlivened by an inexhaustible capacity for enthusiasm. Her political writings, critical in equal measure of the Cold War consensus and of its critics, are less concerned with finding correct positions than with exploring the often absurd circumstances in which agonizing moral decisions are made. ,While the soundness of McCarthy's judgments can sometimes be doubted, her curiosity and intelligence cannot. The intellectual brio and acute judgment that characterizes her best fiction is vividly displayed in this selection of essays, which span McCarthy's career from the late 1930s to the late 1970s. It includes her writings on topics such as fashion magazines, Eugene O'Neill, \"A Streetcar Named Desire,\" \"Look Back in Anger,\" \"Pale Fire,\" J.D. Salinger, Madame Bovary, Italo Calvino, and Watergate. The volume constitutes not only a valuable record of the ideological and cultural controversies that dominated American intellectual life from the Moscow trials to the Watergate hearings, but will also introduce a new generation of readers to a uniquelyforthright and vibrant critical voice.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1171906303l\/125842._SX318_.jpg","pages":400,"rating":3.77,"reviews":5,"title":"A Bolt from the Blue and Other Essays","totalratings":509,"genre":"Non-Fiction","shelf":"Shelf B"},

{"author":"Gregory Shaw","desc":"Theurgy and the Soul is a study of Iamblichus of Syria (ca. 240 325), whose teachings set the final form of pagan spirituality prior to the Christianization of the Roman Empire. Gregory Shaw focuses on the theory and practice of theurgy, the most controversial and significant aspect of Iamblichus's Platonism. Theurgy literally means \"divine action.\",Unlike previous Platonists who stressed the elevated status of the human soul, Iamblichus taught that the soul descended completely into the body and thereby required the performance of theurgic rites revealed by the gods to unite the soul with the One. Iamblichus was once considered one of the great philosophers whose views on the soul and the importance of ritual profoundly influenced subsequent Platonists such as Proclus and Damascius. The Emperor Julian followed Iamblichus's teachings to guide the restoration of traditional pagan cults in his campaign against Christianity. Although Julian was unsuccessful, Iamblichus's ideas persisted well into the Middle Ages and beyond.,His vision of a hierarchical cosmos united by divine ritual became the dominant world view for the entire medieval world and played an important role in the Renaissance Platonism of Marsilio Ficino. Even Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote that he expected a reading of Iamblichus to cause a \"revival in the churches.\" But modern scholars have dismissed him, seeing theurgy as ritual magic or \"manipulation of the gods.\" Shaw, however, shows that theurgy was a subtle and intellectually sophisticated attempt to apply Platonic and Pythagorean teachings to the full expression of human existence in the material world.\"","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1376424789l\/1633901.jpg","pages":284,"rating":4.49,"reviews":8,"title":"Theurgy and the Soul: The Neoplatonism of Iamblichus","totalratings":65,"genre":"Non-Fiction, Philosophy, Religion","shelf":"Shelf B"},
{"author":"Paul Hegarty","desc":"Noise\/Music, looks at the phenomenon of noise in music, from experimental music of the early 20th century to the Japanese noise music and glitch electronica of today. It situates different musics in their cultural and historical context, and analyses them in terms of cultural aesthetics. Paul Hegarty argues that noise is a judgement about sound, that what was noise can become acceptable as music, and that in many ways the idea of noise is similar to the idea of the avant-garde.,While it provides an excellent historical overview, the book's main concern is in the noise music that has emerged since the mid 1970s, whether through industrial music, punk, free jazz, or the purer noise of someone like Merzbow. The book progresses seamlessly from discussions of John Cage, Erik Satie, and Pauline Oliveros through to bands like Throbbing Gristle and the Boredoms. Sharp and erudite, and underpinned throughout by the ideas of thinkers like Adorno and Deleuze, ,Noise\/Music, is the perfect primer for anyone interested in the louder side of experimental music.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1388176443l\/1549125.jpg","pages":232,"rating":3.62,"reviews":25,"title":"Noise\/Music: A History","totalratings":317,"genre":"Art, Non-Fiction","shelf":"Shelf B"},

{"author":"Stephen D. Krasner","desc":"The acceptance of human rights and minority rights, the increasing role of international financial institutions, and globalization have led many observers to question the continued viability of the sovereign state. Here a leading expert challenges this conclusion. Stephen Krasner contends that states have never been as sovereign as some have supposed. Throughout history, rulers have been motivated by a desire to stay in power, not by some abstract adherence to international principles. Organized hypocrisy--the presence of longstanding norms that are frequently violated--has been an enduring attribute of international relations.,Political leaders have usually but not always honored international legal sovereignty, the principle that international recognition should be accorded only to juridically independent sovereign states, while treating Westphalian sovereignty, the principle that states have the right to exclude external authority from their own territory, in a much more provisional way. In some instances violations of the principles of sovereignty have been coercive, as in the imposition of minority rights on newly created states after the First World War or the successor states of Yugoslavia after 1990; at other times cooperative, as in the European Human Rights regime or conditionality agreements with the International Monetary Fund.,The author looks at various issues areas to make his argument: minority rights, human rights, sovereign lending, and state creation in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Differences in national power and interests, he concludes, not international norms, continue to be the most powerful explanation for the behavior of states.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1348636591l\/1072526.jpg","pages":280,"rating":3.69,"reviews":2,"title":"Sovereignty: Organized Hypocrisy","totalratings":90,"genre":"Non-Fiction, Science","shelf":"Shelf B"},

{"author":"Rob Nixon","desc":"The violence wrought by climate change, toxic drift, deforestation, oil spills, and the environmental aftermath of war takes place gradually and often invisibly. Using the innovative concept of slow violence to describe these threats, Rob Nixon focuses on the inattention we have paid to the attritional lethality of many environmental crises, in contrast with the sensational, spectacle-driven messaging that impels public activism today. Slow violence, because it is so readily ignored by a hard-charging capitalism, exacerbates the vulnerability of ecosystems and of people who are poor, disempowered, and often involuntarily displaced, while fueling social conflicts that arise from desperation as life-sustaining conditions erode.,In a book of extraordinary scope, Nixon examines a cluster of writer-activists affiliated with the environmentalism of the poor in the global South. By approaching environmental justice literature from this transnational perspective, he exposes the limitations of the national and local frames that dominate environmental writing. And by skillfully illuminating the strategies these writer-activists deploy to give dramatic visibility to environmental emergencies, Nixon invites his readers to engage with some of the most pressing challenges of our time.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1348999771l\/10429440.jpg","pages":353,"rating":4.35,"reviews":46,"title":"Slow Violence and the Environmentalism of the Poor","totalratings":426,"genre":"Non-Fiction, Philosophy, Science","shelf":"Shelf B"},

{"author":"Francis X. Blouin,William G. Rosenberg","desc":"Processing the Past ,explores the dramatic changes taking place in historical understanding and archival management, and hence the relations between historians and archivists. Written by an archivist and a historian, it shows how these changes have been brought on by new historical thinking, new conceptions of archives, changing notions of historical authority, modifications in archival practices, and new information technologies. The book takes an archival turn by situating archives as subjects rather than places of study, and examining the increasingly problematic relationships between historical and archival work.,By showing how nineteenth- and early twentieth-century historians and archivists in Europe and North America came to occupy the same conceptual and methodological space, the book sets the background to these changes. In the past, authoritative history was based on authoritative archives and mutual understandings of scientific research. These connections changed as historians began to ask questions not easily answered by traditional documentation, and archivists began to confront an unmanageable increase in the amount of material they processed and the challenges of new electronic technologies. ,The authors contend that historians and archivists have divided into two entirely separate professions with distinct conceptual frameworks, training, and purposes, as well as different understandings of the authorities that govern their work. ,Processing the Past ,moves toward bridging this divide by speaking in one voice to these very different audiences. Blouin and Rosenberg conclude by raising the worrisome question of what future historical archives might be like if historical scholars and archivists no longer understand each other, and indeed, whether their now different notions of what is archival and historical will ever again be joined.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1347363220l\/10101750.jpg","pages":272,"rating":3.43,"reviews":9,"title":"Processing the Past: Contesting Authority in History and the Archives","totalratings":70,"genre":"Non-Fiction, Philosophy","shelf":"Shelf C"},

{"author":"Elijah Wald","desc":"From Two Live Crew's controversial comedy to Ice Cube's gangsta styling and the battle rhymes of a streetcorner cypher, rap has always drawn on deep traditions of African American poetic word-play, In Talking 'Bout Your Mama, author Elijah Wald explores one of the most potent sources of rap: the viciously funny, outrageously inventive insult game known as \"the dozens.\" ,So what is the dozens? At its simplest, it's a comic chain of \"yo' mama\" jokes. At its most complex, it's an intricate form of social interaction that reaches back to African ceremonial rituals. Wald traces the tradition of African American street rhyming and verbal combat that has ruled urban neighborhoods since the early 1900s. Whether considered vernacular poetry, aggressive dueling, a test of street cool, or just a mess of dirty insults, the dozens is a basic building block of African-American culture. A game which could inspire raucous laughter or escalate to violence, it provided a wellspring of rhymes, attitude, and raw humor that has influenced pop musicians from Jelly Roll Morton and Robert Johnson to Tupac Shakur and Jay Z. ,Wald goes back to the dozens' roots, looking at mother-insulting and verbal combat from Greenland to the sources of the Niger, and shows its breadth of influence in the seminal writings of Richard Wright, Langston Hughes, and Zora Neale Hurston; the comedy of Richard Pryor and George Carlin; the dark humor of the blues; the hip slang and competitive jamming of jazz; and in its ultimate evolution into the improvisatory battling of rap. From schoolyard games and rural work songs to urban novels and nightclub comedy, and pop hits from ragtime to rap, Wald uses the dozens as a lens to provide new insight into over a century of African American culture. ,A groundbreaking work, Talking 'Bout Your Mama is an essential book for anyone interested in African American cultural studies, history and linguistics, and the origins of rap music.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1348343006l\/13323971.jpg","pages":244,"rating":3.64,"reviews":16,"title":"The Dozens: A History of Rap's Mama","totalratings":92,"genre":"Non-Fiction","shelf":"Shelf C"},

{"author":"Dean Buonomano","desc":"A lively, surprising tour of our mental glitches and how they arise.,With its trillions of connections, the human brain is more beautiful and complex than anything we could ever build, but it's far from perfect. Our memory is unreliable; we can't multiply large sums in our heads; advertising manipulates our judgment; we tend to distrust people who are different from us; supernatural beliefs and superstitions are hard to shake; we prefer instant gratification to long-term gain; and what we presume to be rational decisions are often anything but. Drawing on striking examples and fascinating studies, neuroscientist Dean Buonomano illuminates the causes and consequences of these \"bugs\" in terms of the brain's innermost workings and their evolutionary purposes. He then goes one step further, examining how our brains function-and malfunction-in the digital, predator-free, information-saturated, special effects-addled world that we have built for ourselves. Along the way, Brain Bugs gives us the tools to hone our cognitive strengths while recognizing our inherent weaknesses.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1348441982l\/11213439.jpg","pages":310,"rating":3.83,"reviews":172,"title":"Brain Bugs: How the Brain's Flaws Shape Our Lives","totalratings":2612,"genre":"Sports, Non-Fiction, Science","shelf":"Shelf C"},

When the head of San Francisco's largest HMO dies in his own hospital, no one doubts it is anything but the result of massive injuries inflicted by a random hit-and-run car accident. But the autopsy soon tells a different story-an overdose of potassium killed him, and the attending physician Eric Kensing becomes the prime suspect in a high-profile homicide.,Abe Glitsky, though hindered by the inept bunglings of two politically appointed cops assigned to the investigation, quickly sets his sights on Kensing. Desperate and in need of an attorney, Kensing turns to Dismas Hardy for his defense. But as the pressure mounts to indict Kensing, Hardy goes on the offensive, believing that the murder had little to do with his client, and everything to do with business.

{"author":"Faisal Devji","desc":"Pakistan, founded less than a decade after a homeland for India's Muslims was proposed, is both the embodiment of national ambitions fulfilled and, in the eyes of many observers, a failed state. ,Muslim Zion, cuts to the core of the geopolitical paradoxes entangling Pakistan to argue that India's rival has never been a nation-state in the conventional sense. Pakistan is instead a distinct type of political geography, ungrounded in the historic connections of lands and peoples, whose context is provided by the settler states of the New World but whose closest ideological parallel is the state of Israel.,A year before the 1948 establishment of Israel, Pakistan was founded on a philosophy that accords with Zionism in surprising ways. Faisal Devji understands Zion as a political form rather than a holy land, one that rejects hereditary linkages between ethnicity and soil in favor of membership based on nothing but an idea of belonging. Like Israel, Pakistan came into being through the migration of a minority population, inhabiting a vast subcontinent, who abandoned old lands in which they feared persecution to settle in a new homeland. Just as Israel is the world's sole Jewish state, Pakistan is the only country to be established in the name of Islam.,Revealing how Pakistan's troubled present continues to be shaped by its past, ,Muslim Zion, is a penetrating critique of what comes of founding a country on an unresolved desire both to join and reject the world of modern nation-states.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1361745401l\/16241523.jpg","pages":278,"rating":3.38,"reviews":2,"title":"Muslim Zion: Pakistan as a Political Idea","totalratings":48,"genre":"Non-Fiction, Religion","shelf":"Shelf C"},

He finds their traces in the nooks and crannies of the histories, treatises, plays, and poetry created by the elite. Everyday people come alive through original sources as varied as graffiti, incantations, magical texts, proverbs, fables, astrological writings, and even the New Testament.,Knapp offers a glimpse into a world far removed from our own, but one that resonates through history. \"Invisible Romans\" allows us to see how Romans sought on a daily basis to survive and thrive under the afflictions of disease, war, and violence, and to control their fates before powers that variously oppressed and ignored them.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1347653578l\/11513921.jpg","pages":371,"rating":3.62,"reviews":52,"title":"Invisible Romans","totalratings":329,"genre":"Non-Fiction","shelf":"Shelf C"},

{"author":"Frances R. Westley,Brenda Zimmerman,Michael Patton","desc":"A practical, inspirational, revolutionary guide to social innovation,Many of us have a deep desire to make the world around us a better place. But often our good intentions are undermined by the fear that we are so insignificant in the big scheme of things that nothing we can do will actually help feed the world's hungry, fix the damage of a Hurricane Katrina or even get a healthy lunch program up and running in the local school. We tend to think that great social change is the province of heroes - an intimidating view of reality that keeps ordinary people on the couch. But extraordinary leaders such as Gandhi and even unlikely social activists such as Bob Geldof most often see themselves as harnessing the forces around them, rather than singlehandedly setting those forces in motion. The trick in any great social project - from the global fight against AIDS to working to eradicate poverty in a single Canadian city - is to stop looking at the discrete elements and start trying to understand the complex relationships between them. By studying fascinating real-life examples of social change through this systems-and-relationships lens, the authors of ,Getting to Maybe, tease out the rules of engagement between volunteers, leaders, organizations and circumstance - between individuals and what Shakespeare called \"the tide in the affairs of men.\",Getting to Maybe, applies the insights of complexity theory and harvests the experiences of a wide range of people and organizations - including the ministers behind the Boston Miracle (and its aftermath); the Grameen Bank, in which one man's dream of micro-credit sparked a financial revolution for the world's poor; the efforts of a Canadian clothing designer to help transform the lives of Indigenous women and children; and many more - to lay out a brand new way of thinking about making change in communities, in business, and in the world.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1320502108l\/1341545.jpg","pages":258,"rating":3.75,"reviews":34,"title":"Getting to Maybe: How the World Is Changed","totalratings":326,"genre":"Non-Fiction","shelf":"Shelf C"},

The Battle of Hasting was a close-run battle that could have gone either way--England would be a very different place today had the fatal arrow missed Harold's eye.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1443274101l\/1685639.jpg","pages":319,"rating":3.86,"reviews":7,"title":"Harold II: The Doomed Saxon King","totalratings":42,"genre":"Non-Fiction","shelf":"Shelf C"},
{"author":"Euripides","desc":"Series Copy, Based on the conviction that only translators who write poetry themselves can properly recreate the celebrated and timeless tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, ,The Greek Tragedies in New Translations, series offers new translations that go beyond the literal meaning of the Greek in order to evoke the poetry of the originals. Under the editorship of Herbert Golder and the late William Arrowsmith, each volume includes a critical introduction, commentary on the text, full stage directions, and a glossary of the mythical and geographical references in the plays., One of Euripides' late plays, ,Ion, is a complex enactment of the changing relations between the human and divine orders and the way in which our understanding of the gods is mediated and re-visioned by myths. The story begins years before the play begins, with the rape of the mortal Kreousa, queen of Athens, by Apollo. Kreousa bears Apollos' child in secret then abandons it. Unbeknownst to her, Apollo has the child brought to his temple at Delphi to be reared by the priestess as ward of the shrine. Many years later, Kreousa, now married to the foreigner Xouthos but childless, comes to Delphi seeking prophecy about children. Apollo, however, speaking through the oracle, bestows the temple ward, Ion, on Xouthos as his child. Enraged, Kreousa conspires to kill as an interloper the very son she has despaired of finding. After mother and son both try to kill each other, the priestess reveals the birth tokens that permit Kreousa to recognize and embrace the child she thought was dead. Ion discovers the truth of his parentage and departs for Athens, as a mixed blood of humanity and divinity, to participate in the life of the polis., In ,Ion,, disturbing riptides of thought and feeling run just below the often shimmering surfaces of Euripidean melodrama. Although the play contains some of Euripides' most beautiful lyrical writing, it quivers throughout with near disasters, poorly informed actions and misdirected intentions that almost result in catastrophe. Kreousa says at one point that good and evil do not mix, but Euripides' argument, and what the youthful Ion strives to understand, is that human beings are not only compounded of good and evil, but that the two are often the same thing differently experienced, differently understood, just as beauty and violence are mixed both in the gods and in the mortal world.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1348206142l\/1152993.jpg","pages":112,"rating":3.68,"reviews":49,"title":"Ion","totalratings":662,"genre":"Fantasy, Non-Fiction","shelf":"Shelf C"},

Where violence and poverty and moral transgression go unchecked, even unnoticed. A world of such wild, rocketing energy that, grasping it, anything at all is possible.,Whether traveling through war-ravaged Liberia, mingling with the crowds at a Christian Biker rally, exploring his own authority issues through the lens of this nation's militia groups, or attempting to unearth his inner resources while mining for gold in the wilds of Alaska, Johnson writes with a mixture of humility and humorous candor that is everywhere present.,With the breathtaking and often haunting lyricism for which his work is renowned, Johnson considers in these pieces our need for transcendence. And, as readers of his previous work know, Johnson's path to consecration frequently requires a limning of the darkest abyss.

{"author":"Fritz Ridenour","desc":"Since the days of the Early Church, Christians have struggled to find a way to be 'good'-to please God by their own efforts. They end up carrying a burden God never intended them to bear. And what's more, their brand of Christianity ends up looking like any other religion of the world-bound by joyless rules and rituals. Fritz Ridenour's study of the book of Romans provides an antidote to the pharisaical spirit and shows that Christianity is not a religion but a relationship. It is not man reaching up, but God reaching down. Every Christian can enjoy his or her birthright when they realize who they are in Christ. The result is a life full of hope, joy, power and potential.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1328779296l\/1028314.jpg","pages":176,"rating":3.97,"reviews":17,"title":"How to be a Christian Without Being Religious: Discover the Joy of Being Free in Your Faith","totalratings":153,"genre":"Non-Fiction, Religion","shelf":"Shelf C"},

For Bruner, language is learned by using it. An central to its use are what he calls formats, scriptlike interactions between mother and child--in short, play and games. What goes on in games as rudimentary as peekaboo or hide-and-seek can tell us much about language acquisition.,But what aids the aspirant speaker in his attempt to use language? To answer this, the author postulates the existence of a Language Acquisition Support System that frames the interactions between adult and child in such a way as to allow the child to proceed from learning how to refer to objects to learning to make a request of another human being. And, according to Bruner, the Language Acquisition Support System not only helps the child learn how to say it but also helps him to learn what is canonical, obligatory, and valued among those to whom he says it. In short, it is a vehicle for the transmission of our culture.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1348002709l\/1633907.jpg","pages":146,"rating":4.0,"reviews":1,"title":"Child's Talk: Learning to Use Language","totalratings":34,"genre":"Children","shelf":"Shelf C"},

{"author":"Christoph Ransmayr,John E. Woods","desc":"Novels with explicitly novelistic themes are often bloodless, carrying the fatal odor of the sheltered writing workshop; Austrian writer Ransmayr's first novel, however, is a stunning exception. (His second book, The Last World, was published here last year to critical acclaim.) The underlying concerns of this work are primarily literary--creator vs. creation, history vs. fiction, the nature of metaphor, etc.--but here they inform a singularly gripping tale. A nameless and largely invisible narrator recounts the 1981 disappearance of one Josef Mazzini, whose fascination with a 19th-century polar expedition has pulled him north, to the furthest arctic settlements. Accounts of the two journeys intersect and diverge, challenging the notion of history as linear, seducing the reader with startlingly detailed descriptions of polar exploration. Members of the 19th-century expedition, pursuing honor, glory and other vanities, endure two frigid winters when their ship is trapped in ice: their beards freeze, they are blinded by snow and ill with scurvy, but the Bible is read every Sunday. A century later men approach the icy expanse with snowmobiles and Walkmen, undertaking selfinterested scientific projects. This aggressively intelligent narrative transforms the polar regions into unusually fertile ground. - Publishers Weekly","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1348218433l\/140532.jpg","pages":240,"rating":3.99,"reviews":45,"title":"The Terrors of Ice and Darkness","totalratings":479,"genre":"Non-Fiction, Historical Fiction","shelf":"Shelf C"},

She is perhaps,as well known for her tantalizing brand of Southern Gothic humor as she is for her Catholicism. That these tendencies should be so happily married in her fiction is no longer a surprise. The real surprise is learning that this much beloved icon of American literature did not set out to be a fiction writer, but a cartoonist. This seems to be the last well-kept secret of her creative life. ,Flannery O'Connor: The Cartoons,, the first book devoted to the author's work in the visual arts, emphasizes O'Connor's most prolific period as a cartoonist, drawing for her high school and college publications in the early 1940s. While many of these images lampoon student life and the impact of World War II on the home front, something much more is happening. Her cartoons are a creative threshing floor for experimenting and trying out techniques that are deployed later with such great success in her fiction. O'Connor learns how to set up and carry a joke visually, how to write a good one-liner and set it off against a background of complex visual narration. She develops and asserts her taste for a stock set of character types, attitudes, situations, exaggerations, and grotesques, and she learns how to present them not to distort the truth, but to expose her vision of it.,She worked in both pen & ink and linoleum cuts, and her rough-hewn technique combined with her acidic observations to form a visual precursor to her prose. Fantagraphics is honored to bring the early cartoons of this American literary treasure to a 21st century readership.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1341294925l\/11356255.jpg","pages":144,"rating":3.7,"reviews":50,"title":"Flannery O'Connor: The Cartoons","totalratings":241,"genre":"Art, Non-Fiction","shelf":"Shelf C"},

{"author":"Angela Y. Davis","desc":"With her characteristic brilliance, grace and radical audacity, Angela Y. Davis has put the case for the latest abolition movement in American life: the abolition of the prison. As she quite correctly notes, American life is replete with abolition movements, and when they were engaged in these struggles, their chances of success seemed almost unthinkable. For generations of Americans, the abolition of slavery was sheerest illusion. Similarly,the entrenched system of racial segregation seemed to last forever, and generations lived in the midst of the practice, with few predicting its passage from custom. The brutal, exploitative (dare one say lucrative?) convict-lease system that succeeded formal slavery reaped millions to southern jurisdictions (and untold miseries for tens of thousands of men, and women). Few predicted its passing from the American penal landscape. Davis expertly argues how social movements transformed these social, political and cultural institutions, and made such practices untenable.,In ,Are Prisons Obsolete?,, Professor Davis seeks to illustrate that the time for the prison is approaching an end. She argues forthrightly for \"decarceration\", and argues for the transformation of the society as a whole.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1320521835l\/108428.jpg","pages":128,"rating":4.55,"reviews":1465,"title":"Are Prisons Obsolete?","totalratings":13892,"genre":"Non-Fiction, Philosophy","shelf":"Shelf C"},

{"author":"Ben S. Bernanke","desc":"In 2012, Ben Bernanke, chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve, gave a series of lectures about the Federal Reserve and the 2008 financial crisis, as part of a course at George Washington University on the role of the Federal Reserve in the economy. In this unusual event, Bernanke revealed important background and insights into the central bank's crucial actions during the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Taken directly from these historic talks, ,The Federal Reserve and the Financial Crisis, offers insight into the guiding principles behind the Fed's activities and the lessons to be learned from its handling of recent economic challenges., Bernanke traces the origins of the Federal Reserve, from its inception in 1914 through the Second World War, and he looks at the Fed post-1945, when it began operating independently from other governmental departments such as the Treasury. During this time the Fed grappled with episodes of high inflation, finally tamed by then-chairman Paul Volcker. Bernanke also explores the period under his predecessor, Alan Greenspan, known as the Great Moderation. Bernanke then delves into the Fed's reaction to the recent financial crisis, focusing on the central bank's role as the lender of last resort and discussing efforts that injected liquidity into the banking system. Bernanke points out that monetary policies alone cannot revive the economy, and he describes ongoing structural and regulatory problems that need to be addressed., Providing first-hand knowledge of how problems in the financial system were handled, ,The Federal Reserve and the Financial Crisis, will long be studied by those interested in this critical moment in history.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1416177965l\/16286057.jpg","pages":134,"rating":4.17,"reviews":40,"title":"The Federal Reserve and the Financial Crisis","totalratings":325,"genre":"Non-Fiction","shelf":"Shelf C"},

{"author":"Masanobu Fukuoka","desc":"The earth is in great peril, due to the corporatization of agriculture, the rising climate crisis, and the ever-increasing levels of global poverty, starvation, and desertification on a massive scale. This present condition of global trauma is not \"natural,\" but a result of humanity's destructive actions. And, according to Masanobu Fukuoka, it is reversible. We need to change not only our methods of earth stewardship, but also the very way we think about the relationship between human beings and nature.,Fukuoka grew up on a farm on the island of Shikoku in Japan. As a young man he worked as a customs inspector for plants going into and out of the country. This was in the 1930s when science seemed poised to create a new world of abundance and leisure, when people fully believed they could improve upon nature by applying scientific methods and thereby reap untold rewards. While working there, Fukuoka had an insight that changed his life forever. He returned to his home village and applied this insight to developing a revolutionary new way of farming that he believed would be of great benefit to society. This method, which he called \"natural farming,\" involved working with, not in opposition to, nature.,Fukuoka's inspiring and internationally best-selling book, The One-Straw Revolution was first published in English in 1978. In this book, Fukuoka described his philosophy of natural farming and why he came to farm the way he did. One-Straw was a huge success in the West, and spoke directly to the growing movement of organic farmers and activists seeking a new way of life. For years after its publication, Fukuoka traveled around the world spreading his teachings and developing a devoted following of farmers seeking to get closer to the truth of nature.,Sowing Seeds in the Desert, a summation of those years of travel and research, is Fukuoka's last major work-and perhaps his most important. Fukuoka spent years working with people and organizations in Africa, India, Southeast Asia, Europe, and the United States, to prove that you could, indeed, grow food and regenerate forests with very little irrigation in the most desolate of places. Only by greening the desert, he said, would the world ever achieve true food security.,This revolutionary book presents Fukuoka's plan to rehabilitate the deserts of the world using natural farming, including practical solutions for feeding a growing human population, rehabilitating damaged landscapes, reversing the spread of desertification, and providing a deep understanding of the relationship between human beings and nature. Fukuoka's message comes right at the time when people around the world seem to have lost their frame of reference, and offers us a way forward.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1332132922l\/13552345.jpg","pages":208,"rating":4.32,"reviews":50,"title":"Sowing Seeds in the Desert: Natural Farming, Global Restoration, and Ultimate Food Security","totalratings":509,"genre":"Cooking, Non-Fiction, Philosophy, Science","shelf":"Shelf C"},

{"author":"Jeff Shaara","desc":"NEW YORK TIMES ,BESTSELLER,Continuing the series that began with ,A Blaze of Glory, , Jeff Shaara returns to chronicle another decisive chapter in America's long and bloody Civil War. In ,A Chain of Thunder, , the action shifts to the fortress city of Vicksburg, Mississippi. There, in the vaunted \"Gibraltar of the Confederacy,\" a siege for the ages will cement the reputation of one Union general--and all but seal the fate of the rebel cause.,In May 1863, after months of hard and bitter combat, Union troops under the command of Major General Ulysses S. Grant at long last successfully cross the Mississippi River. They force the remnants of Confederate Lieutenant General John C. Pemberton's army to retreat to Vicksburg, burning the bridges over the Big Black River in its path. But after sustaining heavy casualties in two failed assaults against the rebels, Union soldiers are losing confidence and morale is low. Grant reluctantly decides to lay siege to the city, trapping soldiers and civilians alike inside an iron ring of Federal entrenchments. Six weeks later, the starving and destitute Southerners finally surrender, yielding command of the Mississippi River to the Union forces on July 4--Independence Day--and marking a crucial turning point in the Civil War.,Drawing on comprehensive research and his own intimate knowledge of the Vicksburg Campaign, Jeff Shaara once again weaves brilliant fiction out of the ragged cloth of historical fact. From the command tents where generals plot strategy to the ruined mansions where beleaguered citizens huddle for safety, this is a panoramic portrait of men and women whose lives are forever altered by the siege. On one side stand the emerging legend Grant, his irascible second William T. Sherman, and the youthful \"grunt\" Private Fritz Bauer; on the other, the Confederate commanders Pemberton and Joseph Johnston, as well as nineteen-year-old Lucy Spence, a civilian doing her best to survive in the besieged city. By giving voice to their experiences at Vicksburg, ,A Chain of Thunder, vividly evokes a battle whose outcome still reverberates more than 150 years after the cannons fell silent.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1360096615l\/15981669.jpg","pages":562,"rating":4.19,"reviews":318,"title":"A Chain of Thunder","totalratings":2909,"genre":"Non-Fiction, Historical Fiction","shelf":"Shelf C"},

{"author":"Charlotte Biltekoff","desc":"Eating Right in America, is a powerful critique of dietary reform in the United States from the late nineteenth-century emergence of nutritional science through the contemporary alternative food movement and campaign against obesity. Charlotte Biltekoff analyzes the discourses of dietary reform, including the writings of reformers, as well as the materials they created to bring their messages to the public. She shows that while the primary aim may be to improve health, the process of teaching people to \"eat right\" in the U.S. inevitably involves shaping certain kinds of subjects and citizens, and shoring up the identity and social boundaries of the ever-threatened American middle class. Without discounting the pleasures of food or the value of wellness, Biltekoff advocates a critical reappraisal of our obsession with diet as a proxy for health. Based on her understanding of the history of dietary reform, she argues that talk about \"eating right\" in America too often obscures structural and environmental stresses and constraints, while naturalizing the dubious redefinition of health as an individual responsibility and imperative.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1365625430l\/17134230.jpg","pages":224,"rating":3.9,"reviews":16,"title":"Eating Right in America: The Cultural Politics of Food and Health","totalratings":81,"genre":"Cooking, Sports, Non-Fiction, Science","shelf":"Shelf C"},

A dark-skinned, impoverished child, he grew up under low expectations, Jim Crow legislation, and vigilante terrorism.

{"author":"Fiona MacCarthy","desc":"From the prize winning author of ,William Morris, comes a new biography of Edward Burne-Jones, the greatest British artist of the second half of the nineteenth century. ,The angels on our Christmas cards, the stained glass in our churches, the great paintings in our galleries - Edward Burne-Jones's work is all around us. The most admired British artist of his generation, he was a leading figure with Oscar Wilde in the aesthetic movement of the 1880s, inventing what became a widespread 'Burne-Jones look'. The bridge between Victorian and modern art, he influenced not just his immediate circle but artists such as Klimt and Picasso. In this gripping book Fiona MacCarthy explores and re-evaluates his art and life - his battle against vicious public hostility, the romantic susceptibility to female beauty that would inspire his art and ruin his marriage, his ill health and depressive sensibility, the devastating rift with his great friend and collaborator William Morris as their views on art and politics diverged. ,With new research and fresh historical perspective, ,The Last Pre-Raphaelite, tells the extraordinary, dramatic story of Burne-Jones as an artist, a key figure in Victorian society and a peculiarly captivating man.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1314454380l\/12425859.jpg","pages":656,"rating":4.24,"reviews":29,"title":"The Last Pre-Raphaelite: Edward Burne-Jones and the Victorian Imagination","totalratings":310,"genre":"Art, Non-Fiction, Historical Fiction","shelf":"Shelf C"},

{"author":"Diane Von Furstenberg","desc":"Diane is the frank and compelling story of an extraordinary woman and her adventures in fashion, business, and life. \"Most fairy tales end with the girl marrying the prince. That's where mine began\", says Diane Von Furstenberg. She didn't have to work, but she did. She lived the American Dream before she was thirty, building a multimillion-dollar fashion empire while raising two children and living life in the fast lane.,Von Furstenberg's wrap dress, a cultural phenomenon in the seventies, hangs in the Smithsonian Institution. \"No one was making a little bourgeois dress, so I did,\" she told Newsweek in her 1976 cover story. The dress achieved such popularity that in the five years it was on the market, Diane sold more than five million of them. Her entry into the beauty business in 1979 was as serendipitous and as successful.,Diane learned her trade in the trenches, crisscrossing the country to make personal appearances at department stores, selling her dresses and cosmetics. \"As I was learning to be a woman and enjoying being one, I was sharing my discoveries, designing for my needs, and making a business of it\", she writes. That business had its ups and downs. Eventually, there was so much demand for and exposure of the dress that the market became saturated; on the verge of bankruptcy, she licensed that part of the business, focusing on her fragrance and beauty products.,Von Furstenberg's personal world unraveled a bit in 1980 when her mother, Lily, a survivor of Auschwitz, had a breakdown. Diane of course knew about her mother's experience in the camps, though her mother had never wanted to dwell on it. She understood that her own need for freedom came from her mother's lack of it, and that her resilience derived from her mother's life lesson to always turn a negative into a positive.,Leaving the glitz of Manhattan and the music of Studio 54 behind, Diane escaped to Bali with her children, returning inspired and renewed. With all of this energy, the cosmetics business flourished. But it grew so fast that in 1983 she found herself undercapitalized and was forced to sell.,In 1985, having given up control of her brand to licensees and with her children away at school, Diane turned her back on America and packed for Paris. She spent four years in her new role as part of the literary scene there, trading in her spike heels for flat shoes and tweed.,In 1990, she found she missed the chase and returned to New York to regain control of her name and relaunch her company. Frustrated by the degraded status of her brand and dismissed by the retail community, she searched for a new way to reconnect with her customers. She found it through the revolutionary new medium of teleshopping and once again became a success. However, she still wanted to return to retail.,In 1997, as the wrap dress was making a comeback with the nostalgia for the seventies, Von Furstenberg, with the help of her beautiful daughter-in-law, Alexandra, redesigned the dress for the nineties and made her name relevant to a whole new generation.,Now, at fifty, Diane works to make sense of the contradictions in her life: glamour vs. hard work, European vs. American, daughter of a Holocaust survivor vs. wife of an Austro-Italian prince, mother vs. entrepreneur, lover vs. tycoon. She emerges wiser, stronger, and ever more determined never to sacrifice her passion for life.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1436910854l\/1181223._SY475_.jpg","pages":237,"rating":3.72,"reviews":22,"title":"Diane: A Signature Life: My Adventures in Fashion, Business, and Life","totalratings":266,"genre":"Non-Fiction","shelf":"Shelf C"},

In this book Colin Tudge argues that agriculture in some form was in the repertoire of our ancestors for thousands of years before the Neolithic farming revolution: people did not suddenly invent forced into it over a long period. What we see in the Neolithic Revolution is not the beginning of agriculture on a large scale, in one place, with refined tools.,Drawing on a wide range of evidence from fossil records to the Bible, Tudge offers a persuasive hypothesis about a puzzling epoch in our past. In so doing, he provides new insights into the Pleistocene overkill, the demise of the Neanderthals, the location of the biblical Eden, and much more.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1347292428l\/1007157.jpg","pages":64,"rating":3.74,"reviews":14,"title":"Neanderthals, Bandits and Farmers: How Agriculture Really Began","totalratings":87,"genre":"Non-Fiction, Science","shelf":"Shelf D"},

{"author":"Daniel L. Byman","desc":"The product of painstaking research and countless interviews, ,A High Price, offers a nuanced, definitive historical account of Israel's bold but often failed efforts to fight terrorist groups. Beginning with the violent border disputes that emerged after Israel's founding in 1948, Daniel Byman charts the rise of Yasir Arafat's Fatah and leftist groups such as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine--organizations that ushered in the era of international terrorism epitomized by the 1972 hostage-taking at the Munich Olympics. Byman reveals how Israel fought these groups and others, such as Hamas, in the decades that follow, with particular attention to the grinding and painful struggle during the second intifada. Israel's debacles in Lebanon against groups like the Lebanese Hizballah are examined in-depth, as is the country's problematic response to Jewish terrorist groups that have struck at Arabs and Israelis seeking peace. In surveying Israel's response to terror, the author points to the coups of shadowy Israeli intelligence services, the much-emulated use of defensive measures such as sky marshals on airplanes, and the role of controversial techniques such as targeted killings and the security barrier that separates Israel from Palestinian areas. Equally instructive are the shortcomings that have undermined Israel's counterterrorism goals, including a disregard for long-term planning and a failure to recognize the long-term political repercussions of counterterrorism tactics.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1347623827l\/11683936.jpg","pages":464,"rating":4.04,"reviews":9,"title":"A High Price: The Triumphs and Failures of Israeli Counterterrorism","totalratings":93,"genre":"Non-Fiction","shelf":"Shelf D"},

{"author":"Sybille Haynes","desc":"This comprehensive survey of Etruscan civilization, from its origin in the Villanovan Iron Age in the ninth century B.C. to its absorption by Rome in the first century B.C., combines well-known aspects of the Etruscan world with new discoveries and fresh insights into the role of women in Etruscan society. In addition, the Etruscans are contrasted to the Greeks, whom they often emulated, and to the Romans, who at once admired and disdained them. The result is a compelling and complete picture of a people and a culture.,This in-depth examination of Etruria examines how differing access to mineral wealth, trade routes, and agricultural land led to distinct regional variations. Heavily illustrated with ancient Etruscan art and cultural objects, the text is organized both chronologically and thematically, interweaving archaeological evidence, analysis of social structure, descriptions of trade and burial customs, and an examination of pottery and works of art.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1348437836l\/1625127.jpg","pages":452,"rating":4.08,"reviews":2,"title":"Etruscan Civilization: A Cultural History","totalratings":40,"genre":"Non-Fiction","shelf":"Shelf D"},

{"author":"Tahir Shah","desc":"King Solomon, the Bible's wisest king, also possessed extraordinary wealth. He built a temple at Jerusalem that was said to be more fabulous than any other landmark in the ancient world, heavily adorned with gold from Ophir. The precise location of this legendary land has been one of history's great unsolved mysteries. Long before Rider Haggard's classic adventure novel King Solomon's Mines produced a fresh outbreak of gold fever, explorers, scientists and theologians had scoured the world for the source of the king's astonishing wealth. Tahir Shah takes up the quest, using as his leads a mixture of texts including the Septuagint, the earliest form of the Bible, as well as geological, geographical and folkloric sources. Time and again the evidence points towards Ethiopia, the ancient kingdom in the horn of Africa whose imperial family claims descent from Menelik, the son born to Solomon and the Queen of Sheba. Tahir Shah's trail takes him to a remote cliff-face monastery where the monks pull visitors up on a leather rope, to the ruined castles of Gondar, and to the churches of Lalibela, hewn from solid rock.In the south, he discovers an enormous illegal gold mine where thousands of men, women and children dig with their hands. But the hardest leg of the journey is to the accursed mountain of Tullu Wallel, where legend says there lies an ancient shaft, once the entrance of King Solomon's mines.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1348655880l\/108914.jpg","pages":240,"rating":3.8,"reviews":63,"title":"In Search of King Solomon's Mines","totalratings":590,"genre":"Non-Fiction, Science, Religion","shelf":"Shelf D"},
{"author":"Yael Zerubavel","desc":"Because new nations need new pasts, they create new ways of commemorating and recasting select historic events. In ,Recovered Roots,, Yael Zerubavel illuminates this dynamic process by examining the construction of Israeli national tradition.,In the years leading to the birth of Israel, Zerubavel shows, Zionist settlers in Palestine consciously sought to rewrite Jewish history by reshaping Jewish memory. Zerubavel focuses on the nationalist reinterpretation of the defense of Masada against the Romans in 73 C.E. and the Bar Kokhba revolt of 133-135; and on the transformation of the 1920 defense of a new Jewish settlement in Tel Hai into a national myth. Zerubavel demonstrates how, in each case, Israeli memory transforms events that ended in death and defeat into heroic myths and symbols of national revival.,Drawing on a broad range of official and popular sources and original interviews, Zerubavel shows that the construction of a new national tradition is not necessarily the product of government policy but a creative collaboration between politicans, writers, and educators. Her discussion of the politics of commemoration demonstrates how rival groups can turn the past into an arena of conflict as they posit competing interpretations of history and opposing moral claims on the use of the past. Zerubavel analyzes the emergence of counter-memories within the reality of Israel's frequent wars, the ensuing debates about the future of the occupied territories, and the embattled relations with Palestinians. ,A fascinating examination of the interplay between history and memory, this book will appeal to historians, sociologists, anthropologists, political scientists, and folklorists, as well as to scholars of cultural studies, literature, and communication.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1347580024l\/164673.jpg","pages":360,"rating":3.65,"reviews":7,"title":"Recovered Roots: Collective Memory and the Making of Israeli National Tradition","totalratings":52,"genre":"Non-Fiction","shelf":"Shelf D"},

{"author":"David M. Ortmann,Richard A. Sprott","desc":"Sexual Outsiders: Understanding BDSM Sexualities and Communities delves into the unique experiences of individuals in BDSM communities. While misunderstandings surrounding these communities prevail, BDSM sexuality cuts across race, gender, nationality, and sexual orientation. BDSM describes forms of sexuality that incorporate restraint, pressure, sensation, training, and elements of both erotic and non-erotic power exchange between the engaged parties. Some BDSM \"scenes\" include role-playing, spanking, blindfolds, ropes, and erotic costuming. Sexual Outsiders is designed as a guide for BDSM community members who must wade through the quagmire of unique problems they face: coming out to family, friends and partners; distinguishing abusive relationships from healthy consensual ones; finding and developing community; overcoming shame and denial; exploring whether BDSM sexuality can be a healing tool; gaining access to quality, culturally competent psychotherapy; and finding strategies to develop a healthy sexual self-esteem in the face of current medical and social standards that view them as sick or pathological. The book also serves as an educational primer for those whose partners, friends, and family members are involved in BDSM. In terms of challenges faced by BDSM communities, the most significant is living with a stigmatized sexuality shame, prejudice, discrimination, isolation, depression, and a lack of adequate, competent mental health care. Issues such as coming out as a sexual minority, finding community and partners, and dealing with scenes and relationships that go wrong are some the common experiences shared by members of BDSM communities. Sexual Outsiders employs common sense, good humor, and vivid anecdotes while incorporating basic ideas about human behavior, psychology, philosophy, interviews, history, and clinical case studies to illustrate the real lives and experiences of men and women in BDSM communities. Anyone wanting to learn more about this unique, and more-common-than-you-think expression of sexuality, will find in these pages insight into the various challenges BDSM practitioners face, and the many strengths that people in the BDSM communities have developed in the face of social stigma and prejudice.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1355966286l\/15872471.jpg","pages":173,"rating":4.14,"reviews":18,"title":"Sexual Outsiders: Understanding BDSM Sexualities and Communities","totalratings":111,"genre":"Non-Fiction","shelf":"Shelf D"},

{"author":"James C. Mohr","desc":"A little over a century ago, bubonic plague--the same Black Death that decimated medieval Europe--arrived on the shores of Hawaii just as the islands were about to become a U.S. territory. In this absorbing narrative, James Mohr tells the story of that fearful visitation and its fiery climax--a vast conflagration that engulfed Honolulu's Chinatown. , Mohr tells this gripping tale largely through the eyes of the people caught up in the disaster, from members of the white elite to Chinese doctors, Japanese businessmen, and Hawaiian reporters. At the heart of the narrative are three American physicians--the Honolulu Board of Health--who became virtual dictators when the government granted them absolute control over the armed forces and the treasury. The doctors soon quarantined Chinatown, where the plague was killing one or two people a day and clearly spreading. They resisted intense pressure from the white community to burn down all of Chinatown at once and instead ordered a careful, controlled burning of buildings where plague victims had died. But a freak wind whipped one of those small fires into a roaring inferno that destroyed everything in its path, consuming roughly thirty-eight acres of densely packed wooden structures in a single afternoon. Some 5000 people lost their homes and all their possessions and were marched in shock to detention camps, where they were confined under armed guard for weeks. , Next to the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the Chinatown fire is the worst civic disaster in Hawaiian history. A dramatic account of people struggling in the face of mounting catastrophe, ,Plague and Fire, is a stimulating and thought-provoking read.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1180388568l\/1033768.jpg","pages":256,"rating":3.55,"reviews":18,"title":"Plague and Fire: Battling Black Death and the 1900 Burning of Honolulu's Chinatown","totalratings":51,"genre":"Non-Fiction","shelf":"Shelf D"},

As he put the phone down and stared into the darkness of his hotel room, he feared he'd been handed a political death sentence. The year was 1993, and he would be responsible for an economy that had had seven different currencies in the previous eight years to cope with inflation that had run at 3000 percent a year. Brazil had a habit of chewing up finance ministers with the ferocity of an Amazon piranha. This was just one of the turns in a largely unscripted and sometimes unwanted political career. In exile during the harshest period of the junta that ruled Brazil for twenty years, Cardoso started his political life with a tentative run for the Federal Senate in 1978.

Goody also examines the consequent 'theft' by the West of the achievements of other cultures in the invention of (notably) democracy, capitalism, individualism, and love. The Theft of History discusses a number of theorists in detail, including Marx, Weber and Norbert Elias, and engages with critical admiration western historians like Fernand Braudel, Moses Finlay and Perry Anderson. Major questions of method are raised, and Goody proposes a new comparative methodology for cross-cultural analysis, one that gives a much more sophisticated basis for assessing divergent historical outcomes, and replaces outmoded simple differences between East and West. The Theft of History will be read by an unusually wide audience of historians, anthropologists and social theorists.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1347393077l\/129612.jpg","pages":342,"rating":3.73,"reviews":19,"title":"The Theft of History","totalratings":166,"genre":"Non-Fiction","shelf":"Shelf D"},
{"author":"Henry Rogers","desc":"Phonetics is the scientific study of sounds used in language- how the sounds are produced, how they are transferred from the speaker to the hearer and how they are heard and perceived. ,The Sounds of Language, provides an accessible, general introduction to phonetics with a special emphasis on English. ,Focusing on the phonetics of English, the first section allows students to get an overall view of the subject. Two standard accents of English are presented- RP (Received Pronunciation), the standard accent of England, and GA (General American), the standard accent throughout much of North America. The discussion is arranged so that students can read only the RP or GA portions, if desired. Sixteen additional accents of English spoken around the world are also covered to provide students with wider international coverage.,The author then moves on to introduce acoustics phonetics in an accessible manner for those without a science background. The last section of the book provides a detailed discussion of all aspects of speech with extensive examples from languages around the world.,Containing student-friendly features such as extensive exercises for practising the sounds covered in each chapter; a glossary of technical terms; instructions on how to write phonetic symbols; the latest International Phonetic Alphabet chart and a detailed list of English consonantal variants, The Sounds of Language provides an excellent introduction to phonetics to students of linguistics and speech pathology and students of English as a second language.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1375668609l\/171903.jpg","pages":350,"rating":4.05,"reviews":3,"title":"The Sounds of Language: An Introduction to Phonetics","totalratings":40,"genre":"Non-Fiction","shelf":"Shelf D"},
{"author":"Michael Streissguth","desc":"Waylon Jennings. Willie Nelson. Kris Kristofferson. Three renegade musicians. Three unexpected stars. Three men who changed Nashville and country music forever.,By the late 1960s, Nashville, Tennessee, was firmly established as the center of the booming country music industry and home to what was known as the Nashville Sound, characterized by slick production and adherence to an increasingly overused formula. But the city was changing. Young people from all over the country were streaming into the bohemian West End and colliding with three trailblazing artists who would soon rock the foundations of Nashville's music business.,Surrounded by the street vibes of the West End's burgeoning underground scene and the outlaw protest tradition of Nashville's unlikely civil rights leaders and antiwar protestors, Waylon, Willie, and Kris began resisting the unspoken rules of Nashville's music-making machine and instead forged their own creative paths. Their music, personal and not easily categorized, was more in the vein of rock acts like the Allman Brothers and Bob Dylan, and it communi- cated a stark rawness and honesty that would influence artists of all genres for decades to come.,Studded with a diverse secondary cast including Johnny Cash, Rodney Crowell, Kinky Friedman, Billy Joe Shaver, and others, Streissguth's new book brings to life an incredible chapter in musical history and reveals for the first time a surprising outlaw zeitgeist in Nashville. Based on extensive research and probing interviews with key players, what emerges is a fascinating glimpse into three of the most legendary artists of our times and the definitive story of how they changed music in Nashville and everywhere.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1356140347l\/16248062.jpg","pages":304,"rating":3.61,"reviews":71,"title":"Outlaw: Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, Kris Kristofferson and the Renegades of Nashville","totalratings":538,"genre":"Non-Fiction","shelf":"Shelf D"},

{"author":"Charlotte Dacre,Adriana Craciun","desc":"'Few venture as thou hast in the alarming paths of sin.' This is the final judgement of Satan on Victoria di Loredani, the heroine of Zofloya, or The Moor (1806), a tale of lust, betrayal, and multiple murder set in Venice in the last days of the fifteenth century. The novel follows Victoria's progress from spoilt daughter of indulgent aristocrats, through a period of abuse and captivity, to a career of deepening criminality conducted under Satan's watchful eye. Charlotte Dacre's narrative deftly displays her heroine's movement from the vitalized position of Ann Radcliffe's heroines to a fully conscious commitment to vice that goes beyond that of 'Monk' Lewis's deluded Ambrosio. The novel's most daring aspect is its anatomy of Victoria's intense sexual attraction to her Moorish servant Zofloya that transgresses taboos both of class and race. A minor scandal on its first publication, and a significant influence on Byron and Shelley, Zofloya has been unduly neglected. Contradicting idealized stereotypes of women's writing, the novel's portrait of indulged desire, gratuitous cruelty, and monumental self-absorption retains considerable power to disturb.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1327912129l\/1116977.jpg","pages":303,"rating":3.55,"reviews":143,"title":"Zofloya","totalratings":1699,"genre":"Fantasy, Non-Fiction, Historical Fiction, Horror","shelf":"Shelf D"},

{"author":"Andy  Clark","desc":"From Robocop to the Terminator to Eve 8, no image better captures our deepest fears about technology than the cyborg, the person who is both flesh and metal, brain and electronics. But philosopher and cognitive scientist Andy Clark sees it differently. Cyborgs, he writes, are not something to be feared--we already are cyborgs., In ,Natural-Born Cyborgs,, Clark argues that what makes humans so different from other species is our capacity to fully incorporate tools and supporting cultural practices into our existence. Technology as simple as writing on a sketchpad, as familiar as Google or a cellular phone, and as potentially revolutionary as mind-extending neural implants--all exploit our brains' astonishingly plastic nature. Our minds are primed to seek out and incorporate non-biological resources, so that we actually think and feel through our best technologies. Drawing on his expertise in cognitive science, Clark demonstrates that our sense of self and of physical presence can be expanded to a remarkable extent, placing the long-existing telephone and the emerging technology of telepresence on the same continuum. He explores ways in which we have adapted our lives to make use of technology (the measurement of time, for example, has wrought enormous changes in human existence), as well as ways in which increasingly fluid technologies can adapt to individual users during normal use. Bio-technological unions, Clark argues, are evolving with a speed never seen before in history. As we enter an age of wearable computers, sensory augmentation, wireless devices, intelligent environments, thought-controlled prosthetics, and rapid-fire information search and retrieval, the line between the user and her tools grows thinner day by day. This double whammy of plastic brains and increasingly responsive and well-fitted tools creates an unprecedented opportunity for ever-closer kinds of human-machine merger, he writes, arguing that such a merger is entirely natural., A stunning new look at the human brain and the human self, ,Natural Born Cyborgs, reveals how our technology is indeed inseparable from who we are and how we think.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1348696967l\/170465.jpg","pages":229,"rating":3.82,"reviews":29,"title":"Natural-Born Cyborgs: Minds, Technologies, and the Future of Human Intelligence","totalratings":322,"genre":"Art, Technology, Philosophy, Science, Non-Fiction","shelf":"Shelf D"},

Recently, ancient magic has hit a high in popularity, both as an area of scholarly inquiry and as one of general, popular interest. In ,Magic, Witchcraft, and Ghosts in the Greek and Roman Worlds, Daniel Ogden presents three hundred texts in new translations, along with brief but explicit commentaries.

Alongside descriptions of sorcerers, witches, and ghosts in the works of ancient writers, it reproduces curse tablets, spells from ancient magical recipe books, and inscriptions from magical amulets. Each translation is followed by a commentary that puts it in context within ancient culture and connects the passage to related passages in this volume. Authors include the well known (Sophocles, Herodotus, Plato, Aristotle, Virgil, Pliny) and the less familiar, and extend across the whole of Greco-Roman antiquity.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1180738283l\/1071312._SX318_.jpg","pages":368,"rating":4.09,"reviews":13,"title":"Magic, Witchcraft, and Ghosts in the Greek and Roman Worlds: A Sourcebook","totalratings":163,"genre":"Fantasy, Non-Fiction, Religion","shelf":"Shelf D"},

{"author":"Hanna Spencer","desc":"From the preface: \"For forty-five years I had not opened the wooden box with the fancy hand-carved lid. I knew what was in it. Together with miscellaneous keepsakes and photographs, it contained six notebooks written in German. This was the journal I kept from 1938 to 1941, during a crucial period in many people's lives, including mine. The box had remained locked since 1942, when I had pulled down my own \"iron curtain,\" shutting out the memories preserved on those pages. But the time eventually came for the curtain to be raised. The main reason for this change of mind was my profound regret that I had not quizzed my parents more about their personal history; I didn't want this to happen to my children and grandchildren. Thus I brought myself to open the box, literally and figuratively, and set about translating the diaries from German into English - strictly for the use of my family, or so I thought.\" Hanna Fischl, a Czech of Jewish descent, was a twenty-four-year-old teacher in a German-speaking part of Czechoslovakia when Hitler's shadow loomed over Europe in 1938. No longer able to associate openly with her lover, Hans Feiertag, the talented, Christian composer whom she had loved since her teens, she began writing a diary at his request so that, once they were reunited, he could learn about her life while they had been apart. Written in a touching and candid style, Hanna's Diary, 1938-1941 is the result of that request. Hanna's Diary, 1938B1941 offers an intimate view of sweeping historical events that engulfed Europe and the world, evoking the creeping fear, desperate hopes, desertion of friends, and sense of isolation that Hanna Spencer felt as Nazism spread. The diary follows Spencer to England - where she faced misery of a different kind - and then to Canada, where, as a young immigrant with a PhD, she worked in her uncle's glove-making factory before finally landing a teaching job in Ottawa. Spencer describes her experiences lecturing on Czechoslovaki's history and its takeover by the Nazis, and her resulting celebrity on the Ontario lecture circuit. Written with clear wit and a sharp eye for detail, Hanna's Diary, 1938B1941 is a must-read for anyone interested in the human side of the Second World War.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1361150123l\/1042760.jpg","pages":216,"rating":4.0,"reviews":3,"title":"Hanna's Diary, 1938-1941: Czechoslovakia to Canada","totalratings":34,"genre":"Non-Fiction","shelf":"Shelf D"},
{"author":"D.A. Carson,Mark     Ashton,R. Kent Hughes,Timothy J. Keller","desc":"'What is at stake is authenticity. . . . Sooner or later Christians tire of public meetings that are profoundly inauthentic, regardless of how well (or poorly) arranged, directed, performed. We long to meet, corporately, with the living and majestic God and to offer him the praise that is his due.'---D. A. Carson Worship is a hot topic, but the ways that Christians from different traditions view it vary greatly. What is worship? More important, what does it look like in action, both in our corporate gatherings and in our daily lives? These concerns---the blending of principle and practice---are what Worship by the Book addresses. Cutting through cultural cliches, D. A. Carson, Mark Ashton, Kent Hughes, and Timothy Keller explore, respectively: -Worship Under the Word -Following in Cranmer's Footsteps -Free Church Worship: The Challenge of Freedom -Reformed Worship in the Global City 'This is not a comprehensive theology of worship, ' writes Carson. 'Still less is it a sociological analysis of current trends or a minister's manual chockfull of 'how to' instructions.' Rather, this book offers pastors, other congregational leaders, and seminary students a thought-provoking biblical theology of worship, followed by a look at how three very different traditions of churchmanship might move from this theological base to a better understanding of corporate worship. Running the gamut from biblical theology to historical assessment all the way to sample service sheets, Worship by the Book shows how local churches in diverse traditions can foster corporate worship that is God-honoring, Word-revering, heartfelt, and historically and culturally informed","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1328847541l\/145835.jpg","pages":256,"rating":3.91,"reviews":52,"title":"Worship by the Book","totalratings":514,"genre":"Non-Fiction, Religion","shelf":"Shelf D"},

{"author":"William S. Burroughs","desc":"In 1970, William S. Burroughs and artist Malcolm McNeill began a small collaborative project on a comic entitled The Unspeakable Mr. Hart, which appeared in the first four issues of Cyclops, England's first comics magazine for an adult readership. Soon after, Burroughs and McNeill agreed to collaborate on a book-length meditation on time, power, and control, and corruption that evoked the Mayan codices and specifically, the Mayan god of death, Ah Pook. Ah Pook is Here was to include their character Mr. Hart, but stray from the conventional comics form to explore different juxtapositions of images and words.,Ah Pook was never finished in its intended form. In a 1979 prose collection that included only the words from the collaboration, Ah Pook is Here and Other Texts (Calder, 1979), Burroughs explains in the preface that they envisioned the work to be \"one that falls into neither the category of the conventional illustrated book nor that of a comix publication.\" Rather, the work was to include \"about a hundred pages of artwork with text (thirty in full-color) and about fifty pages of text alone.\" The book was conceived as a single painting in which text and images were combined in whatever form seemed appropriate to the narrative. It was conceived as 120 continuous pages that would 'fold out.' Such a book was, at the time, unprecedented, and no publisher was willing to take a chance and publish a \"graphic novel.\",However, Malcolm McNeill created nearly a hundred paintings, illustrations, and sketches for the book, and these, finally, are seeing the light of day in The Lost Art of Ah Pook. (Burroughs' text will not be included.) McNeill himself is an exemplary craftsman and visionary painter whose images have languished for over 30 years, unseen. Even in a context divorced from the words, they represent a stunning precursor to the graphic novel form to come. Sara J. Van Ness contributes an historical essay chronicling the long history of Burroughs' and McNeill's work together, including its incomplete publishing history with Rolling Stone's Straight Arrow Press, the excerpt that ran in Rush magazine, and the text that was published without pictures.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1357252183l\/13030867.jpg","pages":168,"rating":4.26,"reviews":3,"title":"The Lost Art of Ah Pook Is Here: Images from the Graphic Novel","totalratings":35,"genre":"Art","shelf":"Shelf D"},
{"author":"Andro Linklater","desc":"With the same mix of compelling narrative history and captivating historical argument that made his previous book, ,Measuring America,, such a success, Andro Linklater relates in fascinating detail how, the borders and boundaries that formed states and a nation inspired the sense of identity that has have ever since been central to the American experiment.,Linklater opens with America's greatest surveyor, Andrew Ellicott, measuring the contentious boundary between Pennsylvania and Virginia in the summer of 1784; and he ends standing at the yellow line dividing the United States and Mexico at Tijuana. In between, he chronicles the evolving shape of the nation, physically and psychologically. As Americans pushed westward in the course of the nineteenth century, the borders and boundaries established by surveyors like Ellicott created property, uniting people in a desire for the government and laws that would protect it. Challenging Frederick Jackson Turner's famed frontier thesis, Linklater argues that we are , thus, defined not by open spaces but by boundaries. \"What Americanized the immigrants was not the frontier experience\" Linklater writes, \"but the fact that it took place inside the United States frontier.\" Those same borders had the ability to divide as well as unite, as the great battle over internal boundaries during the Civil War would show. By century's end, however, we were spreading U.S. power beyond our borders, an act that, seen through Linklater's eyes, offers an intriguing perspective on our role in the world today.,Linklater's great achievement is to weave these provocative arguments into a dramatic storyline, wherein the actions of Ellicott, Thomas Jefferson, the treasonous general James Wilkinson, Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas, and numerous hitherto invisible settlers, all illuminate the shaping of the nation. This brilliant book will alter forever readers' perception of America and what it means to be an American.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1312045023l\/1174337.jpg","pages":304,"rating":3.65,"reviews":22,"title":"The Fabric of America: How Our Borders and Boundaries Shaped the Country and Forged Our National Identity","totalratings":101,"genre":"Art, Non-Fiction, Science","shelf":"Shelf D"},

Christopher Wright is a proven interpreter and communicator of the Old Testament, and in this commentary he masterfully opens our eyes to see and understand the message of Ezekiel. Ezekiel's vision of the glory of God--its departure and return--is first set within Israel's history and then in the culmination of God's promises in Christ. Embedded in the pattern of the strange, the bizarre and the wonderful is a word that still speaks to God's people today.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1395001992l\/1379960.jpg","pages":368,"rating":4.15,"reviews":12,"title":"The Message of Ezekiel: A New Heart and a New Spirit","totalratings":67,"genre":"Non-Fiction, Religion","shelf":"Shelf D"},

{"author":"Paul Strathern","desc":"The computer has revolutionized the modern age of communication and has touched every part of modern life. Without a doubt, the development of the computer was a massive leap forward in humankind's progress and will stand as one of the twentieth century's greatest achievements. But how many of us know how it really works? \"Turing And The Computer\" offers a brilliant encapsulation of the groundwork that led to the invention of the computer as we know it, and an absorbing account of the man who helped develop it, only to be largely forgotten after his death. Eccentric and principled, Turing would lay aside a brilliant career in mathematics to serve his country by breaking German codes during the Second World War. Openly homosexual, he would later be put on trial on indecency charges and forced to undergo hormone treatments that wrecked his body and his spirit. But the modern machine he helped create lives on.Concise and thoroughly compelling, \"Turing And The Computer\" is for all those curious about the philosophy and mechanics behind the now indispensable computer, and for anyone awed by the spark of invention that inspires its birth.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1315249107l\/1116635.jpg","pages":112,"rating":3.53,"reviews":27,"title":"Turing and the Computer","totalratings":175,"genre":"Non-Fiction, Science","shelf":"Shelf D"},

Jon Ronson's exploration of a potential hoax being played on the world's top neurologists takes him, unexpectedly, into the heart of the madness industry. An influential psychologist who is convinced that many important CEOs and politicians are, in fact, psychopaths teaches Ronson how to spot these high-flying individuals by looking out for little telltale verbal and nonverbal clues. And so Ronson, armed with his new psychopath-spotting abilities, enters the corridors of power. He spends time with a death-squad leader institutionalized for mortgage fraud in Coxsackie, New York; a legendary CEO whose psychopathy has been speculated about in the press; and a patient in an asylum for the criminally insane who insists he's sane and certainly not a psychopath. ,Ronson not only solves the mystery of the hoax but also discovers, disturbingly, that sometimes the personalities at the helm of the madness industry are, with their drives and obsessions, as mad in their own way as those they study. And that relatively ordinary people are, more and more, defined by their maddest edges.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1364166270l\/12391521.jpg","pages":275,"rating":3.93,"reviews":7399,"title":"The Psychopath Test: A Journey Through the Madness Industry","totalratings":129944,"genre":"Science, Non-Fiction, Mystery, Sports","shelf":"Shelf D"},

{"author":"Bruce Sanguin","desc":"In March 2005, the United Nations released its Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. Among the findings: 2\/3 of the world's ecosystems are seriously degraded; 90 percent of the world's fish stocks are depleted; and climate change is not just something that might happen, it is already upon us. Many people, including many Christians, will hear this and delude themselves into thinking that technology can and will save the day. A wiser and more helpful response, especially for Christans, is to find a way to step back into the flow of nature from which we have extricated ourselves. In Darwin, Divinity, and the Dance of the Cosmos, Bruce Sanguin shows us the way. Sanguin draws on the latest scientific understandings of the nature of the universe and weaves them together with biblical meta-narratives and frequently overlooked strands of the Judeo-Christian tradition to create an ecological and truly evolutionary Christian theology - a feat few theologians have even attempted. The importance of this accomplishment can hardly be overstated. As Sanguin writes, It's time for the Christian church to get with the cosmological program. We need new wineskins for the new wine the Holy One is pouring out in the 21st century. Twenty-first-century science has provided us with new a new story of creation that needs to inform our biblical stories of creation. We now know, for instance, that we live in an evolving or evolutionary universe. Evolution is the way that the Holy creates in space and in time, in every sphere: material, biological, social, cultural, psychological, and spiritual. This new cosmology simply cannot be contained by old models and images of God, or by old ways of being the church. As his starting point, Sanguin encourages readers to rediscover awe - an attitude very much absent from the modern mindset. We don't see what is before us, he writes, and as a result, we are plundering our planet at an unprecedented rate. If we could see what is before our eyes, day in and day out, the sacred radiance of creation would drop us to our knees and render us speechless. Central to this recovery of awe is the new Great Story, the 14-billion-year history of the cosmos. Into this Great Story, first told by Thomas Berry and by mathematical physicist and cosmologist Brian Swimme, Sanguin reintroduces the presence God. Heady as all this sounds, it has very practical implications for the mission of the church. Sanguin writes: In the first centuries after Jesus' death, his disciples looked around at their world and found that what was needed by way of response to the crisis of their age was hospitals for the sick and food for the poor. This is what compassion required of them. Mission is determined by the context in which the church finds itself in each new age. I am suggesting that, today, there is nothing more critical than a compassionate response to the plight of our planet. The church must be at the forefront of shifting human consciousness away from an ethic of domination for economic gain and toward a spirituality of awe. This book - and more importantly the work of integration it suggests - represents a fundamental challenge to our theological and liturgical models. But for those who are ready and willing to embark on an exciting theological journey of discovery, it also represents a rich opportunity to become reacquainted with the Spirit of God moving in and through the very dynamics of an unfolding universe.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1348351266l\/1031628.jpg","pages":288,"rating":3.67,"reviews":6,"title":"Darwin, Divinity, and the Dance of the Cosmos: An Ecological Christianity","totalratings":30,"genre":"Religion","shelf":"Shelf E"},

{"author":"Shashi Tharoor","desc":"A definitive account of Indias international relations from an expert in the field.,Indian diplomacy, a veteran told Shashi Tharoor many years ago, is like the love-making of an elephant: it is conducted at a very high level, accompanied by much bellowing, and the results are not known for two years. In this lively, informative and insightful work, the award-winning author and parliamentarian brilliantly demonstrates how Indian diplomacy has become sprightlier since then and where it needs to focus in the world of the 21st century. Explaining why foreign policy matters to an India focused on its own domestic transformation, Tharoor surveys Indias major international relationships in detail, evokes the countrys soft power and its global responsibilities, analyses the workings of the Ministry of External Affairs, Parliament and public opinion on the shaping of policy, and offers his thoughts on a contemporary new grand strategy for the nation, arguing that India must move beyond non-alignment to multi-alignment. His book offers a clear-eyed vision of an India now ready to assume new global responsibility in the contemporary world. Pax Indica is another substantial achievement from one of the finest Indian authors of our times.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1342256957l\/15750844.jpg","pages":449,"rating":3.88,"reviews":144,"title":"Pax Indica: India and the World of the 21st Century","totalratings":1960,"genre":"Non-Fiction, Science","shelf":"Shelf E"},

{"author":"David Cunningham","desc":"In the 1960s, on the heels of the ,Brown vs. Board of Education, decision and in the midst of the growing Civil Rights Movement, Ku Klux Klan activity boomed, reaching an intensity not seen since the 1920s, when the KKK boasted over 4 million members. Most surprisingly, the state with the largest Klan membership-more than the rest of the South combined-was North Carolina, a supposed bastion of southern-style progressivism.,Klansville, U.S.A., is the first substantial history of the civil rights-era KKK's astounding rise and fall, focusing on the under-explored case of the United Klans of America (UKA) in North Carolina. Why the UKA flourished in the Tar Heel state presents a fascinating puzzle and a window into the complex appeal of the Klan as a whole. Drawing on a range of new archival sources and interviews with Klan members, including state and national leaders, the book uncovers the complex logic of KKK activity. David Cunningham demonstrates that the Klan organized most successfully where whites perceived civil rights reforms to be a significant threat to their status, where mainstream outlets for segregationist resistance were lacking, and where the policing of the Klan's activities was lax. Moreover, by connecting the Klan to the more mainstream segregationist and anti-communist groups across the South, Cunningham provides valuable insight into southern conservatism, its resistance to civil rights, and the region's subsequent dramatic shift to the Republican Party.,Klansville, U.S.A., illuminates a period of Klan history that has been largely ignored, shedding new light on organized racism and on how political extremism can intersect with mainstream institutions and ideals.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1347659318l\/15856686.jpg","pages":360,"rating":3.45,"reviews":17,"title":"Klansville, U.S.A.: The Rise and Fall of the Civil Rights-Era Ku Klux Klan","totalratings":97,"genre":"Non-Fiction","shelf":"Shelf E"},

{"author":"Juvenal,Persius,Susanna Morton Braund","desc":"The bite and wit of two of antiquity's best satirists are captured here in a new Loeb Classical Library edition, a vivid and vigorous translation facing the Latin text.,Persius (34-62 CE) and Juvenal (writing maybe 60 years later) were heirs to the style of Latin verse satire developed by Lucilius and Horace, a tradition mined in Susanna Braund's introduction and notes. Her notes also give guidance to the literary and historical allusions that pepper Persius's and Juvenal's satirical poems--which were clearly aimed at a sophisticated urban audience. Both poets adopt the mask of an angry man, and sharp criticism of the society in which they live is combined with flashes of sardonic humor in their satires. Whether targeting common and uncommon vices, the foolishness of prayers, the abuse of power by emperors and the Roman elite, the folly and depravity of Roman wives, or decadence, materialism, and corruption, their tone is generally one of righteous indignation.,Juvenal and Persius are seminal as well as stellar figures in the history of satirical writing.

{"author":"Amy Licence","desc":"As Tudors go, Elizabeth of York is relatively unknown. Yet through her marriage to Henry VII she became the mother of the dynasty, with her children including a King of England (Henry VIII) and Queens of Scotland (Margaret) and France (Mary Rose), and her direct descendants including three Tudor monarchs, two executed queens and, ultimately, the Stuart royal family. Although her offspring took England into the early modern world, Elizabeth's upbringing was rooted firmly in the medieval world, with its courtly and religious rituals and expectations of women. The pivotal moment was 1485. Before then, her future was uncertain amid the turbulent Wars of the Roses, Elizabeth being promised rst to one man and then another, and witnessing the humiliation and murder of her family. Surviving the bloodbath of the reign of her uncle, Richard III, she slipped easily into the roles of devoted wife and queen to Henry VII and mother to his children, and has been venerated ever since for her docility and beauty. Yet was she as placid as history has suggested? In fact, she may have been a deeply cultured and intelligent survivor who learnt to walk a difficult path through the twists and turns of fortune. Perhaps she was more of a modern woman than historians have given her credit for.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1360284997l\/17073779.jpg","pages":256,"rating":4.01,"reviews":27,"title":"Elizabeth of York: The Forgotten Tudor Queen","totalratings":280,"genre":"Non-Fiction","shelf":"Shelf E"},

{"author":"Murray Shanahan","desc":"To understand the mind and its place in Nature is one of the great intellectual challenges of our time, a challenge that is both scientific and philosophical. How does cognition influence an animal's behaviour? What are its neural underpinnings? How is the inner life of a human being constituted? What are the neural underpinnings of the conscious condition?,Embodiment and the Inner Life approaches each of these questions from a scientific standpoint. But it contends that, before we can make progress on them, we have to give up the habit of thinking metaphysically, a habit that creates a fog of philosophical confusion. From this post-reflective point of view, the book argues for an intimate relationship between cognition, sensorimotor embodiment, and the integrative character of the conscious condition.,Drawing on insights from psychology, neuroscience, and dynamical systems, it proposes an empirical theory of this three-way relationship whose principles, not being tied to the contingencies of biology or physics, are applicable to the whole space of possible minds in which humans and other animals are included. Embodiment and the Inner Life is one of very few books that provides a properly joined-up theory of consciousness, and will be essential reading for all psychologists, philosophers, and neuroscientists with an interest in the enduring puzzle of consciousness.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1348553141l\/10829455.jpg","pages":218,"rating":4.11,"reviews":5,"title":"Embodiment and the Inner Life: Cognition and Consciousness in the Space of Possible Minds","totalratings":37,"genre":"Religion, Art, Philosophy, Science, Non-Fiction","shelf":"Shelf E"},

For the first time in history, American and Soviet fighting men and tanks stood arrayed against each other, only yards apart. One mistake, one overzealous commander-and the trip wire would be sprung for a war that would go nuclear in a heartbeat. On one side was a young, untested U.S. president still reeling from the Bay of Pigs disaster. On the other, a Soviet premier hemmed in by the Chinese, the East Germans, and hard-liners in his own government. Neither really understood the other, both tried cynically to manipulate events. And so, week by week, the dangers grew.Based on a wealth of new documents and interviews, filled with fresh- sometimes startling-insights, written with immediacy and drama, Berlin 1961 is a masterly look at key events of the twentieth century, with powerful applications to these early years of the twenty- first.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1348663363l\/10626601.jpg","pages":579,"rating":4.1,"reviews":183,"title":"Berlin 1961","totalratings":1581,"genre":"Non-Fiction","shelf":"Shelf E"},

Lentfer's storytelling achieves its joys and universality not via grand summations but via grounded self-giving, familial intimacy, funny friendships, attentive griefs, and full-bodied immersion in the Alaskan rainforest. The writing is honest, intensely lived, and overflowing with heart: broken, mended, and whole.\",a \"David James Duncan, author of ,The Brothers K, and ,God Laughs & Plays,Hank Lentfer, listened to cranes passing over his home in southeast alaska for twenty years before bothering to figure out where they were going. On a very visceral level, he didn't want to know. After all, cranes gliding through the wide skies of Alaska are the essence of wildness. But the same animals, pecking a living between the cornfields and condos of California's Central Valley, seem trapped and diminished. A former wildlife biologist and longtime conservationist, Lentfer had come to accept that no number of letters to the editor or trips to D.C. could stop the spread of clear cuts, alter the course of climate change, or ensure that his beloved cranes would always appear. And he had no idea that following the paths of cranes would lead him to the very things he was most afraid of: parenthood, responsibility, and actions of hope in a frustrating and warming world. ,Faith of Cranes, is Lentfer's quiet, lyrical memoir of his home and community near Glacier Bay that reveals a family's simple acts -- planting potatoes, watching cranes, hunting deer -- as well as a close and eccentric Alaskan community. It shows how several thousand birds and one little girl teach a new father there is no future imaginable that does not leave room for compassion and grace.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1348527658l\/11086506.jpg","pages":179,"rating":4.24,"reviews":24,"title":"Faith of Cranes: Finding Hope and Family in Alaska","totalratings":135,"genre":"Non-Fiction","shelf":"Shelf E"},
{"author":"Alan Huffman","desc":"Tim Hetherington (1970-2011) was one of the world's most distinguished and dedicated photojournalists, whose career was tragically cut short when he died in a mortar blast while covering the Libyan Civil War. Tim won many awards for his war reporting, and was nominated for an Academy Award for the critically acclaimed documentary, ,Restrepo,. Hetherington's dedication to his career led him time after time into war zones, and unlike some other journalists, he did not pack up after the story had broken.,In ,Here I Am,, journalist and freelance writer Alan Huffman tells Hetherington's life story, and through it analyzes what it means to be a war reporter in the twenty-first century. Huffman recounts Hetherington's life from his first interests in photography, through his critical role in reporting the Liberian Civil War, to his tragic death in Libya. Huffman also traces Hetherington's photographic milestones, from his iconic and prize-winning photographs of Liberian children, to the celebrated portraits of sleeping U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan. ,Here I Am, explores the risks, challenges, and thrills of war reporting, and is a testament to the unique work of people like Hetherington, who risk their lives to give a voice to people ravaged by war.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1369869966l\/15814966.jpg","pages":256,"rating":4.2,"reviews":47,"title":"Here I Am: The Story of Tim Hetherington, War Photographer","totalratings":401,"genre":"Art, Non-Fiction","shelf":"Shelf E"},

It not only tells the story of a great man's life-it also tells us how to understand the ultimate source of his greatness and happiness. Moreover, that understanding goes far deeper than the abolitionist achievements for which Wilberforce is honored, astounding though they were. William Wilberforce's secret, as revealed in this book, was that he made the journey from self-centeredness, achievement-centeredness, and political-centeredness to God-centeredness. And he made it with Christlike joy.\", -Jonathan Aitken,Against great obstacles William Wilberforce, an evangelical Christian and a member of Parliament, fought for the abolition of the African slave trade and against slavery itself until they were both illegal in the British Empire.,Many are aware of Wilberforce's role in bringing an end to slavery in Great Britain, but few have taken the time to examine the beliefs and motivations that spurred him on for decades. In this concise volume, John Piper tells the story of how Wilberforce was transformed from an unbelieving, young politician into a radically God-centered Christian, and how his deep spirituality helped to change the moral outlook of a nation.,As world leaders debate over how to deal with a host of social justice and humanitarian crises, a closer look at Wilberforce's life and faith serves as an encouragement and example to all believers.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1369825899l\/106615.jpg","pages":76,"rating":4.12,"reviews":83,"title":"Amazing Grace in the Life of William Wilberforce","totalratings":672,"genre":"Non-Fiction, Religion","shelf":"Shelf E"},
{"author":"Susan Whitfield","desc":"In the first 1,000 years after Christ, merchants, missionaries, monks, mendicants, and military men traveled on the vast network of Central Asian tracks that became known as the Silk Road. Linking Europe, India, and the Far East, the route passed through many countries and many settlements, from the splendid city of Samarkand to tiny desert hamlets. Susan Whitfield creates a rich and varied portrait of life along the greatest trade route in history in a vivid, lively, and learned account that spans the eighth through the tenth centuries. Recounting the lives of ten individuals who lived at different times during this period, Whitfield draws on contemporary sources and uses firsthand accounts whenever possible to reconstruct the history of the route through the personal experiences of these characters.,Life along the Silk Road, brings alive the now ruined and sand-covered desert towns and their inhabitants. Readers encounter an Ulghur nomad from the Gobi Desert accompanying a herd of steppe ponies for sale to the Chinese state; Ah-long, widow of a prosperous merchant, now reduced to poverty and forced to resort to law and charity to survive; and the Chinese princess sent as part of a diplomatic deal to marry a Turkish kaghan. In the process we learn about women's lives, modes of communication, weapons, types of cosmetics, methods of treating altitude sickness in the Tibetan army, and ways that merchants cheated their customers. Throughout the narrative, Whitfield conveys a strong sense of what life was like for ordinary men and women on the Silk Road--everyone from itinerant Buddhist monks, to Zoroastrians and Nestorian Christians seeking converts among the desert settlers, to storytellers, musicians, courtesans, diviners, peddlers, and miracle-workers who offered their wares in the marketplaces and at temple fairs. A work of great scholarship, ,Life along the Silk Road ,is at the same time extremely accessible and entertaining.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1347679737l\/164257.jpg","pages":253,"rating":3.68,"reviews":40,"title":"Life along the Silk Road","totalratings":423,"genre":"Non-Fiction","shelf":"Shelf E"},

The preeminent historian of the American musical (,New York Times,), he brings boundless energy and enthusiasm buttressed by an arsenal of smart anecdotes (,Wall Street Journal,). Now Mordden offers an entirely fresh and infectiously delightful history of American musical theatre.,Anything Goes ,stages a grand revue of the musical from the 1700s through to the present day, narrated in Mordden's famously witty, scholarly, and conversational style. He places us in a bare rehearsal room as the cast of Oklahoma! changes history by psychoanalyzing the plot in the greatest of the musical's many Dream Ballets. And he gives us tickets for orchestra seats on opening night-raising the curtain on the pleasures of Victor Herbert's The Red Mill and the thrill of Porgy and Bess. Mordden examines the music, of course, but also more neglected elements. Dance was once considered as crucial as song; he follows it from the nineteenth century's zany hoofing to tap combinations of the 1920s, from the injection of ballet and modern dance in the 1930s and '40s to the innovations of Bob Fosse. He also explores the changing structure of musical comedy and operetta, and the evolution of the role of the star. Fred Stone, the avuncular Scarecrow in the Wizard of Oz, seldom varied his acting from part to part; but the versatile Ethel Merman turned the headlining role inside out in Gypsy, playing a character who was selfish, fierce, and destructive.,From ballad opera to burlesque, from Fiddler on the Roof to Rent, the history and lore of the musical unfolds here in a performance worthy of a standing ovation.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1369820772l\/17296912.jpg","pages":360,"rating":3.78,"reviews":11,"title":"Anything Goes: A History of American Musical Theatre","totalratings":101,"genre":"Art, Non-Fiction","shelf":"Shelf E"},

{"author":"Umberto Eco","desc":"\"Come stroll with me through the leafy glades of narrative...\" With Umberto Eco as companion and guide, who could resist such an invitation? In this exhilarating book, we accompany him as he explores the intricacies of fictional form and method. Eco draws us in by means of a novelist's techniques, making us his collaborators in the creation of his text and in the investigation of some of fiction's most basic mechanisms. How does a text signal the type of reader it wants, and how does it \"stage\" for us, through its style and voice, a certain version of the author? What is the relation between this \"model reader\" and \"model author\"? How does narrative lead us on, persuade us to lose ourselves in its depths? The range of Eco's examples is astonishing - from fairy tales, through Flaubert, Poe, and Manzoni, to Ian Fleming, Mickey Spillane, and Casablanca. In a detailed analysis of one of his favorite texts, Gerard de Nerval's Sylvie, Eco examines the uses of temporal ambiguity, demystifying the \"mists\" in the literary forest. In another chapter, he takes detective fiction and pornography as a basis for discussing narrative pace - strategic speeding up and slowing down - and the relationship between real time and narrative time. And in yet another chapter, we follow Eco as he shadows the musketeer D'Artagnan through the streets of seventeenth-century Paris, a trail that leads us to the uncertain boundary between story and history. Fiction is parasitically dependent on reality; but reality, too, feeds on fiction. Here, the book reveals its serious side. What are the implications for society when the line between reality and fiction becomes blurred? How are stories (\"plots\" in the mostinsidious sense of the word) constructed over the course of time? In order to be responsible citizens of the world, Eco shows, we must be skilled and incisive readers. Getting lost in the blurry region where the real and the fictional merge can be a disturbing experience.

{"author":"Kenneth Morgan","desc":"In this ,Very Short Introduction,, Kenneth Morgan provides a wide-ranging thematic introduction to modern Australia, examining the main features of its history, geography and culture since the beginning of European settlement in New South Wales in 1788. It highlights the distinctive features of Australian life by placing contemporary developments in historical perspective, by paying attention to Australia's indigenous culture, and by making connections between Australia and the wider world. Morgan also balances his discussion of the successful growth of Australian institutions and democratic traditions with the struggles that occurred in the making of modern Australia--in other words, between the optimistic approach to life in the Antipodes and the more negative view of the black armband tradition.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1349106986l\/13689053.jpg","pages":150,"rating":3.59,"reviews":8,"title":"Australia: A Very Short Introduction","totalratings":63,"genre":"Non-Fiction, Science","shelf":"Shelf E"},

{"author":"Stephen B. Oates","desc":"\"The Whirlwind of War\" is the second book in prize-winning historian and biographer Stephen B. Oates' extraordinary \"Voices of the Storm\" trilogy, which began with \"The Approaching Fury\", Oates' compelling narrative about the 40 tumultuous years that led to \"America's Armageddon\". An intensely dramatic and intimate portrayal of the people, events, influences and consequences of the American Civil War, \"The Whirlwind of War\" builds on the great themes and follows many of the important figures that were introduced in \"The Approaching Fury\".,Oates brings his moving narrative of the complex, bloody and destructive war to vivid and memorable life by writing in the first person, impersonating the voices and assuming the viewpoints of several of the principal figures: the rival presidents, Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson Davis; the rival generals, Robert E. Lee, Ulysses S. Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman; the great black abolitionist, editor and orator, Frederick Douglass; the young Union battlefield nurse, Cornelia Hancock; the brilliant head of the Chicago Sanitary Commission and cocreator of the northern Sanitary Fair, Mary Livermore; the Confederate socialite and political insider, Mary Boykin Chesnut; the assassin, John Wilkes Booth; and the greatest poet of the era, Walt Whitman, who speaks in the coda about the meaning of war and Lincoln's death.,As the book moves through the war years, the interconnecting dramatic monologues lend passion and a strong sense of immediacy and freshness to the story. The protagonist in one monologue becomes the antagonist in another. Each speaker takes his or her turn onstage, serving as narrator for critical events in which he or she was the major instigator and participant or eyewitness.,Often revisionist but always persuasive, Oates brings powerful new insights, facts and conclusions to his narrative. For example, drawing on his own research and that of modern technical scholarship on the assassination, Oates convincingly describes Booth as a Confederate agent, working with the approval and support of the highest authorities in Richmond, probably Jefferson Davis himself, and explains how his plots to abduct and then to assassinate Lincoln were part of several schemes to be executed by rebel secret service men.,Oates also portrays Sherman, Lee, Jefferson Davis, Lincoln and Mary Lincoln in new and in-depth ways. Thus they are seen in a more realistic light, rather than how they have become positively or negatively mythologized over the years.,Exciting, powerful, highly revealing and driven by character and narrative, \"The Whirlwind of War\" makes a significant contribution to American and Civil War literature, and its people and voices will linger long in our memory.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1183035036l\/1368115._SX318_.jpg","pages":846,"rating":3.98,"reviews":5,"title":"The Whirlwind of War: Voices of the Storm, 1861-1865","totalratings":59,"genre":"Non-Fiction","shelf":"Shelf E"},

{"author":"Gladys Mitchell","desc":"When two male students execute a rag against the nearby Calladale women's agricultural college--a prank involving rhubarb and dead rats--the ladies decide to give the men back some of their own. They collect the litter and sneak it over to a pub which happens to be a favorite with the men. Their plans of storing the collection are not successful, however, as the ornamental horse carriage beside the pub where they were going to store the contents is already occupied--with the unrecognizable body of a woman clothed in a Calladale blazer. ,Inquiries at the college reveal that one student, Norah Palliser, has been missing for several days. When Dame Beatrice enters the investigation (at the request of nephew Carey Lestrange, who is teaching pig farming at Calladale) another incident comes to light: days ago, a student returning late to the campus encountered the spectral vision of a cloaked, larger-than-life horseman galloping down the college's moonlit path. Dame Beatrice finds the story most interesting, and other facts soon emerge: Norah Palliser was secretly married to a penniless painter named Coles; she may have been connected with Carey's predecessor, a man with questionable morals nicknamed by the students as \"Piggy\" Basil; and petty thefts have been occuring within the college.,The coroner reports death by coniine poisoning, probably extracted from the root of spotted hemlock; there's also the puzzling fact that the victim is physically older than Norah Palliser's twenty-three years. But if the body isn't Norah Palliser-Coles, who is it? And where is Norah? Dame Beatrice travels to Northern Ireland, upper Scotland and southern Italy on her rounds of alibi-breaking, until she is ready to place her cards on the table and reveal the solution.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1307463327l\/1505216.jpg","pages":239,"rating":3.74,"reviews":10,"title":"Spotted Hemlock","totalratings":104,"genre":"Mystery","shelf":"Shelf E"},
{"author":"Heather Horst,Daniel Miller","desc":"Anthropology has two main tasks: to understand what it is to be human and to examine how humanity is manifested differently in the diversity of culture. These tasks have gained new impetus from the extraordinary rise of the digital. This book brings together several key anthropologists working with digital culture to demonstrate just how productive an anthropological approach to the digital has already become.,Through a range of case studies from Facebook to Second Life to Google Earth, ,Digital Anthropology, explores how human and digital can be defined in relation to one another, from avatars and disability; cultural differences in how we use social networking sites or practise religion; the practical consequences of the digital for politics, museums, design, space and development to new online world and gaming communities.

As a user, you can make any kind of customization you want, from choosing the keystrokes that invoke your favorite commands to creating a whole new work environment that looks like nothing ever developed before. It's all in Emacs Lisp -- and in this short but fast-paced book.,GNU Emacs is more than an editor; it's a programming environment, a communications package, and many other things. To provide such a broad range of functions, it offers a full version of the Lisp programming language -- something much more powerful than the little macro languages provided in other editors (including older versions of Emacs). GNU Emacs is a framework in which you can create whole new kinds of editors or just alter aspects of the many functions it already provides.,In this book, Bob Glickstein delves deep into the features that permit far-reaching Emacs customizations. He teaches you the Lisp language and discusses Emacs topics (such as syntax tables and macro templates) in easy-to-digest portions. Examples progress in complexity from simple customizations to extensive major modes.,You will learn how to write interactive commands, use hooks and advice, perform error recovery, manipulate windows, buffers, and keymaps, exploit and alter Emacs's main loop, and more. Each topic is explored through realistic examples and a series of successive refinements that illustrate not only the Emacs Lisp language, but the development process as well, making learning pleasant and natural.","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1387750228l\/1639039.jpg","pages":240,"rating":3.8,"reviews":4,"title":"Writing GNU Emacs Extensions","totalratings":55,"genre":"Technology, Science","shelf":"Shelf E"},
