Interview answers:
1. Look for the aisle that has the genre, then look for the author's last name.
2. Auto correct is extremely important. Also nice to get feedback, like where there is a thump after clicking
3. Title and author name are the main ones, also shelf position and genre.
4. Spine, using its color, design, font, publisher sticker
5. Alphabetical, dewy decimal system is ok
6. Two-Three, maybe four depending on how long the window to return the books is.
